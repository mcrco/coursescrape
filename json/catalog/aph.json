In theoretical systems, it requires modelling by stochastic differential equations, whose solutions can be analytically intractable except for the simplest of Gaussian processes. Research on classical and quantum systems has revealed, however, that noise is essential when boosting hidden signatures by the phenomenon known as stochastic resonance. Many different methods proposed for inducing stochastic resonance are now revolutionizing measurement and modeling in fields as wide ranging as nonlinear optics and photonics, quantum communication, SQUID devices, neurophysiology, hydrodynamics, climate research and finance. This course, designed to appeal to theorists and experimentalists alike, is conducted in survey and seminar style.
