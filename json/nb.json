        "description": "The class focuses on quantitative studies of problems in systems neuroscience. Students will study classical work such as Hodgkin and Huxley's landmark papers on the ionic basis of the action potential, and will move from the study of interacting currents within neurons to the study of systems of interacting neurons. Topics will include lateral inhibition, mechanisms of motion tuning, local learning rules and their consequences for network structure and dynamics, oscillatory dynamics and synchronization across brain circuits, and formation and computational properties of topographic neural maps. The course will combine lectures and discussions, in which students and faculty will examine papers on systems neuroscience, usually combining experimental and theoretical/modeling components.",

        "description": "A brain-machine interface (BMI) records neural activity, decodes the intent of the participant, and generates control signals to operate assistive devices. Bi-directional BMIs can write signals back into the brain though electrical stimulation based on the recorded neural activity. These neurotechnologies have been advancing rapidly with therapeutic potential for several neurological diseases and disorders. Through lectures and reviews of the literature, the course will cover motor BMIs for robotics and communication, cognitive neural prosthetics, stimulation to restore sensation, and different invasive and non-invasive recording and stimulation technologies.\n Given in alternate years; not offered 2024-25.",
