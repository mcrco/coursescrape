    "comments": [
        "Overall this class was pretty good for someone who has never touched code in their life. At first it seemed overwhelming but when the labs got easier, the content was much easier to absorb. There are several TAs that are all very helpful and I think this course has many available office hours for someone who doesn't have much previous experience and they're all worthwhile. Sometimes the course seems a little disorganized but its very flexible and Hovik is easy to reach out to for any concerns.",
        "Take the class. There are many non-CS classes that do not require CS as a pre-requisite, but definitely should. Having a basic understanding of CS will make your life at Caltech much simpler. The TAs for the class are incredibly helpful and are arguably the best resource available, however, Prof. Hovik is extremely kind and understanding and goes to great efforts to work with students and make the class applicable to many disciplines.",
        "Suggestions for future students who want to place out CS1: 1 documentation is the most important; 2 don't forget \"__init__ == __main__\" in python; 3 error handling thoroughly. For CS1, I learned something from it in a relaxing pace because I have some experience of python before. CS1 contributes to my relaxing first quarter at Caltech. Professor Hovik is great and approachable. She cares for her students and devotes a lot of time. Most TAs are experienced and great too. The course is disorganized however. It's the morning of Dec 23, but I haven't received grades for two sections in the final. The contents of CS1 are hybridized. You will not only learn basic programming but also a little scientific computing such as csv and matplotlib. Programming is much more important as I believe.",
        "Bugs can be annoying. Go to office hours if you need help",
        "I recommend starting the coding assignment the day it's assigned. Even if all you do it look over the assignment it's never a good idea to start an assignment the day it's due because you never know what bugs you'll run into. The class has a decent workload but it's worth it for the amount you'll learn.",
        "Do the readings. Just do the readings. And do assignments early so you can go to office hours and get help from TAs. One of the only appropriately united core classes.",
        "The pacing for the course was too fast the first half of the term for someone that does not have much prior experience in coding. The first few labs were really difficult. But things gets easier to understand starting with lab04, as the format of the labs changed to filling in the blanks, instead of confused students having to write the entire function. Starting at lab04, the starter codes are really helpful to understanding the contents for me, and I always refer to the labs to do my homework mini projects. With regard to the homework mini projects, mp1 was quite manageable, but mp2 and mp3 are very hard. I spent at least 20 hours on both. Starting with mp4 to mp8, I averaged around 5 hours of figuring it out myself, and going to office hours for 4-8 hours. For the more difficult mini projects, office hours are usually very crowded, usually there are not enough TAs to efficiently answer your questions, as many needs help on those. My suggestion is to start your mini projects early in the week to try to go to the Monday office hours as there will be less people there. Don't stress out too much. I thought I would fail at the beginning of the term, but eventually catched up. Definitely go through the readings and any other notes available and go to office hours for homework, it is impossible to figure out the homework yourself especially if you do not have any prior experience in coding.",
        "This is honestly a pretty nice class but it's in its beginning stages. Be sure to give yourself ample amount of time to complete each assignment.",
        "Go to lecture and ask questions. Go to office hours if you need help.",
        "If you don't have programming experience and anticipate having a lot of questions, you should attend the lectures and follow along with exercises in class. If you wait until your project is nearly due to start figuring out how to code, you'll have problems.",
        "This class truly doesn't need any prerequisites. For those who haven't coded before, there is a steep learning curve but the professor and every TA is extremly invested in helping you learn and would gladly take any extra time to explain anything. The professor in particular is more interested in if you learn the material then if you score well and would do almost anything to ensure this. For homework sets, reworks were offered based on the number of lectures you attended. While reworks are helpful, each set must be handed in on time or you can't use a rework. Each rework has its own deadline shortly after the set is graded back which makes working on reworks a tight squeeze into a busy schedule with ongoing set due dates. Extensions are possible to attain and should be requested as soon as you feel the need.",
        "Some units presented in the course will take longer than expected to understand and do the assignments for if one does not already have prior experience in programming.",
        "Since almost all the homework was non-collaborative, I would highly recommend going to office hours because it helps you understand the content and also solve any issues you have. The TAs are quite helpful, but sometimes they aren't sure of the code specifications either, so make sure you know what the code is supposed to be doing. The workload is somewhat heavy, but if you go to office hours to work, you can make the most efficient use of your time. The homework and lab specifications are usually extremely long and sometimes convoluted, but they are helpful, so make sure to read them carefully. I found going to lecture useful since I could bring up questions I had spontaneously, which really helped me deepen my understanding, and the professor always makes sure to answer questions in lecture so it was super helpful. There is also tons of material posted online, and I could always ask a question and be pointed in the right direction.",
        "",
        "You spend 3 hours in lecture, 1 hour in the lab (less if you finish early), and about 3-5 hours on the homework assignments. You're not required to know anything about programming going into the class. I would recommend at least looking at the homework sets a few days before they're due so you can plan out how long they'll take and when to do them, so you have time to run tests and debug. I would also recommend taking advantage of the reworks.",
        "good class content (goes over python basics, loops, arrays, dictionaries, csv processing, graphs and matplotlib, and my favorite content: java and object-oriented programming). a good bit of the labs and problem sets were also good and sometimes fun to do. however, the class is poorly organized.",
        "don't start your assignments last minute. use office hours and if you get stuck just stop working and go to office hours, other wise your gonna waste your time and its gonna end up being the most silliest mistake ever. lectures are helpful and she tells you what kind of topics you need for the homework",
        "I believe the amount of time you put in the homework is more than the 4-5h expected. However, it helped me learn a lot and totally understand why theyre difficult.",
        "Attend lectures or you'll have to catch up on reading outside of class.",
        "This is overall a great introductory course to coding. Units breakdown is very fair, and the professor and TAs provide a surplus of opportunities to ask questions and better your understanding of course materials. If you have zero prior coding experience before taking this class, it may require some more proactivity in terms of attending office hours, but the professor and TAs make the course very beginner friendly.",
        "For someone without coding experience, the most challenging weeks were the first three (due to the sheer overwhelm of material) and the last two (introducing a new programming language when you barely have a feel for the first). DON'T GIVE UP - it will get easier. My one piece of advice to power through is to go to all the office hours. I probably spent anywhere between 3-5 hours every week in OH's, and was gradually able to do more and more of the sets (\"MP's\") without guidance as the weeks progressed. The TAs are wonderful, and Prof Hovik is dedicated and willing to work with students, so reach out if you need help! Other info that might be useful: The communication mainly occurred over Discord, and there were Lecture Checks that could earn you reworks on labs/MPs (attend 3 classes = one rework).",
        "Do not wait until the last minute to start doing the MP projects.",
        "Course is pretty easy if you have coding experience. Of all my frosh fall classes, this was the easiest one. Class will be much harder if you've never coded before though.",
        "It will be pretty easy if you have programming experience but you'll still learn programming conventions, style, and slightly more efficient ways of programming. It's also good review, and depending on how much you know you may learn things about dictionaries/file IO. The professor (Hovik) is very supportive and they are almost always available to help.",
        "This class is a breeze for students that have already studied basic Python and Java skills. For students that are coding for the first time, go to all classes and as many OH as possible -- it is a little faster-paced.",
        "For those who have had prior CS experience before, but either did not take the placement exam or were unsure about taking the placement exam, this class will be a breeze, especially if you have had prior Python experience. Sets, on average, took 1-3 hours, although, one set did take 4 hours, since we had to design our own plotting functions. I really loved the introduction to matplotlib and numpy. Although I have used it in research before, it was great getting a brushup on such libraries!Documentation style is really emphasized in this course, and I would highly take this class seriously, as you will not only get familiar with syntax again, but you will learn to code the right way.I am ultimately glad I took this class, as I am more confident in my programming abilities than before.",
        "I would highly recommend this course even if you don't need to take it. I'm a math major with python experience and I still think it was so worthwhile to learn new skills and hone in on my code.",
        "Although I was able to get through the class without any previous CS background, I was spending a significant amount more time in labs and on assignments than my peers. I was on average spending 4-5x more time on the assignments than estimated in the spec. Having any level of previous experience would definitely make this class much easier. If you are struggling with the course because you have no experience with CS whatsoever, you are much better off finding a dean's tutor to help you than attending office hours. So many students attend office hours that it is only beneficial to attend if you have an idea of how to approach the problem already, or if you have a simple/quick question.",
        "I think in its current state, CS 1 is a mixed bag of a class. There needs to be improvement within the structure and content of the course, but there is a great support network of TAs available to help and they definitely should be utilized.",
        "Try and complete the Lab in the given session",
        "The class content had thoughtful and interesting material, and the projects were fun to complete. I already learned most of the course content on my own previously (I probably should have taken the CS1 placement exam) so the class was a breeze, but doing the projects still takes time regardless of experience so I spent around 2 hours per week on the class. With my experience, labs took 30 minutes or less. Class may be a little fast-paced if you have never programmed before, but assignments were structured in a way such that you didn't need to learn specific details for everything in order to have a working project (i.e. part of the code was completed for you, and some parts were left for you to finish). Prof. Hovik is kind, responsive, and puts a lot of effort into the class, so don't be afraid to reach out.",
        "I think the workload builds, but you're supposed to get better at programming as the class goes on. I think that the difficulty throughout the course was expected. There was definitely one MP that was overwhelming to work with, maybe a second one, but otherwise, it was smooth sailing.",
        "If you do not have any experience with Python or coding, the lectures will be very helpful for you! El is a fantastic instructor, and the TAs are also very available to help with mini projects and any other questions. As someone who came into the course with some experience with Python, I was able to get by without attending lectures and diligently going over the readings and lecture slides. I would usually start the mini projects at least 3 days before they were due, though it probably would have been better to start earlier."
