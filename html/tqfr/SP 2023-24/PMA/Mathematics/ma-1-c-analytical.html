      <td>I took this class as non math major. It gets quite abstract and difficult to understand after the midterm, especially if you arent familiar with that kind of math (many Ma 5 frosh seemed more comfortable) but ties up pretty nicely by the end with Stokes Theorem. They say that you need multi experience but all I had done was Ph 1b anal and was fine</td>

      <td>I highly recommend the analytical track. It supplies so much more understanding than practical would have provided for me. The discussions on differential forms was a topic that which I expect to be helpful to me in the future, which as far as I know was not directly covered in the practical track. Grading is not too bad either. Don't be too terse with your proofs and you'll be fine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I believe this class got more relaxed than past years: the problem sets and exams were for the most part pretty chill (lots of computation), so don't worry about that too much. Also, there's some sort of curve to not penalize those who chose the analytical track. The second half of the class definitely gets into some basic topics within some pretty advanced math (topology and differential geometry) which can be intimidating, but quite interesting and enjoyable to work with. The main difference between anal. and prac. occurs in the second half of the course where in anal. the focus is to generalize line and surface integration to dimensions of 4+ (which requires the language of differential forms and manifolds), while practical only focuses on line and surface integrals in 3 dimensions. </td>

      <td>The class is very useful. It definitely teaches more than in the practical track and requires a little bit more work.

      <td>A lot of people may give very negative views on this course and this is understandable, given that a lot of aspects of this course were weird -- like a very theoretical approach during lecture but pretty computational problem sets.<br><br>However, after this course, you come away with a knowledge of differential forms, which, if you take the time to learn them, are actually super cool and so powerful, and computing any sort of flux integral is so easy to set up using them, compared to the practical track method. Also, Professor Yu can be pretty entertaining at times -- his examples for real-life intuition can be really funny. Also, this course hasn't been very difficult, the problem sets are pretty short, and the grading is pretty generous, so if you have an interest in the material and enjoyed Ma1a and Ma1b anal, then you shouldn't be discouraged from taking this class -- a lot of concepts tie nicely together!</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Looking at past TQFRs, this class became a lot easier in SP23, and it has continued to be manageable this year as well.  It seems like the hardest questions in previous years turned into "bonus" questions, still listed on the set but not worth any points.  They are often cool and instructive, but often involve sneaky things that aren't really covered in class.  The sets do indeed take between 3-6 hours now - this class is correctly united!<br><br>Overall, I do feel like I have learned!  When I was a frosh, registering for classes, I was strongly discouraged from taking Ma1canal.  However, the class is very manageable and I feel like I have learned a lot along the way!<br><br>This class is organized in a way that roughly follows Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds.  The precise organization of the class follows Tony Yu's own lecture notes very closely.  The lectures directly follow the notes, and Tony usually provides helpful figures / examples that are sometimes not reported.  The notes losslessly cover all the necessary content for the course.  Recitation notes are posted and also directly correspond to the content covered in recitation, which usually provides worked examples helpful for the sets / exams.<br>The first two-ish questions on each set usually are very computational - things that feel like they could be covered in prac.  Solving these questions usually feels like applying definitions from the notes and churning out algebra.  There are also a few questions that usually involve the "higher power" ideas of the class - these proof-based questions are really instructive and apply the ideas of concepts.  Often, these questions have ideas that are never directly addressed in lecture, but you can usually find analogues or worked examples that help in one of Spivak (Calculus on Manifolds), Rudin (Principles of Mathematical Analysis), or Zorich (Mathematical Analysis).  These external works, especially Spivak and Rudin, often give a little bit more content that supplements the bare definitions from the lecture notes.<br><br>The first half of the course develops an idea of Euclidean spaces, differentiation / continuity using topology, and the inverse and implicit function theorem.  The midterm was roughly aligned with the difficulty of the sets (indeed, it was just set #5, just with a time limit).  After the midterm, we covered multivariable integration with the Riemann integral, and then developed differential forms and techniques of integration (and at the very very end, classical vector calculus).  Differential forms are not introduced in a very intuitive way - to me at first, they felt like applying definitions and theorems to solve problems on the set.  However, the longer they stew, the more intuitive they start to become.  It really helped also to skim through "A Visual Introduction to Differential Forms and Calculus on Manifolds" by JP Fortney, which presents - in detail - many equivalent definitions and worked examples of differential forms and their theorems.  Many computations necessary for the sets - which aren't fully worked out in lecture - are explicitly worked out in Fortney.  He also presents the important results and gives several equivalent formulations of them, which is very helpful for building intuition.  The final involved mostly computation, applications of theorems already worked out.  (Also, there were a free 5 points on both the midterm and final for filling out the midterm course feedback form / final TQFR :).<br><br>The very last theorem explored in the class was Stokes' theorem.  From Spivak: "The proof of this theorem is an utter triviality - a straightforword computation.  However, even the statement of this triviality cannot be understood without a horde of difficult definitions."  It feels like all of the material of the class simply builds up up to the generalized Stokes' theorem - then, the last week is just applications.  All of classical vector calculus is given one lecture at the very end.  It didn't really feel like I really understood any real multivariable calculus until this last week :)</td>

      <td>This course is definitely for math majors, more so than 1b analytical, so if you are thinking about taking it based on 1b analytical, keep in mind that this course is substantially different. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>People often say "if you are a math major, you'll enjoy taking 1c analytical", and I've realized that this can be true, but definitely isn't always the case. <br>The idea of having a 'Math 1c analytical' is strange, because the theoretical course content is inherently hard to teach in a meaningful way in a short timespan without prerequisite knowledge. And if you also want to teach how to use practical strategies and solve practical problems on top of that (which they try to do), the pacing of the course gets all messed up. It feels like, instead of understanding both theoretical and practical aspects to a meaningful degree, you don't get much of either. Problems on psets often demand techniques and knowledge they never mention in class/notes. Similarly, the abstract things they cover such as exterior algebras and differential forms are not given the nuance for you to actually develop an intuitive understanding or appreciation for them. <br>Generally the way this course goes is that the first 5-6 weeks are a manageable pace, and at around week 6-7 they get into those abstract areas I mentioned, and that's when it gets weird.<br>You definitely can get something out of this course, but you'll have to put some extra work into it, finding supplementary textbooks or youtube videos (and a lot of googling) to really understand why this works and why it's interesting. You can get by in this course by memorizing strategies to solve the problems they give you and asking TAs for help with the odd question, but at that point, you could also just take prac.</td>

      <td>From a math major, just take practical instead. The course failed to teach a big part of the multivariable calculus needed for physics and the manifolds part of the class is presented in a very uninsightful way. I had heard this from upperclassmen and still took analytical, but now I regret it. The course only goes completely off the rails after add day, so you won't be able to see it happen before you can change to practical. </td>

      <td>Yes, this course is more difficult and a larger commitment than the practical track, but hey you came to Caltech to learn! Many upperclassmen will say to just do Prac as it makes your life easier. I don't disagree, but I don't think analytical is so difficult to bar someone from, putting in requisite effort, getting an A. Further, you learn a lot more. Rather than blind computation, you learn actual calculus theory, and that gives you a deeper understanding that will (especially if you are going into a hard science) probably be helpful. It is also just good training for to take a more difficult class. That's my take - take Analytical!</td>

      <td>Do yourself a favor and take prac, you'll realize after midterms how smart of a decision that is. Other people, often math majors, will tell you that math 1c analytical is fine and very helpful later on. I listened to these people and I regretted it so much after the prof started talking about differential forms. The class really goes off the rails after drop day, so don't get your hopes up. Professor Tony Yu will not explain anything beyond his notes, which aren't helpful to begin with. He does not listen to feedback, his deadlines are at 5pm for no reason, and his lectures don't relate to the sets. They do relate to the midterm and final however, so you very well might end up with perfect scores on his sets only to get destroyed by the exams like me. This class doesn't teach multivariable calculus, it teaches topology and manifolds at a level so abstract and unintuitive that it's incomprehensible. Remember that (at least in my year) this class can not be taken pass/fail for some reason, so please just take prac.</td>

      <td>Do not take this class.<br><br>I'm saying this as a pure math major who took and enjoyed the analytical tracks of Ma 1b, Ph 1b, and Ph 1c. Upperclassmen told me that I should enjoy taking this class as a math major -- I deeply regret this. Take the practical track instead.<br><br>Fundamentally, this class is not a multivariable calculus class. If you don't know multi before taking it, you certainly won't learn any in this class. This class is primarily a differential geometry class, taught through the lens of topology. The sets were 40% trivial computations (that we never learned how to do, like line integrals), 40% tedious computations (that would take a page or two of busy work), and 20% topology / differential geometry proofs (which were usually very obvious and thus a waste of time to prove). However, it never felt like we were well equipped to answer any of the questions on the sets; as I mentioned, we were never taught how to do any of the computations that you would expect to learn in a multivariable calculus class, like line/surface integrals, vector calculus identities, multivariable Taylor expansion, etc.<br><br>The professor, Tony, made class extremely unenjoyable. The topics presented were unmotivated and difficult to follow, and he did not answer questions during lecture in any useful way. Moreover, I was an ombud for the course, and he actively ignored all feedback brought up to him during our meeting. For example, I asked him to post the LaTeX files for the sets. He said no. I brought up the fact that what was asked on the sets did not match what was taught in lecture. He said that was intentional. The biggest request that I had been asked to relay as an ombud was to change the homework due date from 5 PM Tuesday to 11:59 PM Tuesday. When I asked him, he instead suggested 11:59 PM Monday (a day earlier). I told him that this was in fact the opposite of what people have been asking for and would worsen the issue that people had. He then said that 5 PM Tuesday was fine. From class and the ombud meeting, it has become overwhelmingly clear that Tony is incredibly unapproachable and certainly does not care about his students or their learning.<br><br>The Head TA, Alan, was also unhelpful. During recitations, he would often struggle to come up with the reasoning behind the steps he was doing, even when asked. I once emailed him asking about one of the homework problems, as my friend and I had used two seemingly valid methods but got different answers. When I asked him why the methods weren't producing the same result, he replied, "Dear [name], I believe you can figure this out by yourself. Best, Alan." Obviously, this was unhelpful. His grading has also been very unfair, especially on the midterm. He takes off a lot of points for small mistakes, and just replies "closed" to regrade requests, instead of reexamining the grading. Tony told me to email Alan about the 5 PM due date issue, to which I got no response. However, Tony himself did reply, suggesting that "students experiencing difficulties contact their TA individually for additional assistance and possible deadline extensions". The two issues with this, however, are that (1) I have contacted the TA (Alan) individually, and received no additional assistance, and (2) the syllabus policy states that any extension requires a note of support from the dean's office, which can be difficult to obtain for unexpected situations in a short timeframe.<br><br>For all of these issues, I ended up needing to meet with the ARC about this class. This was decidedly the worst class I have taken at this school, causing me to go through periods of the worst mental health I've experienced since I got here. It's been the class that has most made me want to switch majors from pure math to something else, or even to drop out entirely. I wish I had switched to the practical track when I had the chance.<br><br>I can't say it enough: Do not take this class.</td>

      <td>If Prof. Yu is teaching the course, I would recommend taking practical track instead, if you are not a pure math major. The same content can be learned online/from his notes, which he basically reads in class (the only benefit of going to class are the occasional pictures). If you are thinking of taking analytical, I assume you have a decent familiarity with multivariable calculus already, so just go to practical, get an easy A+, and study the material on your own if truly interested. The course was not worth it but the content was.</td>

However, the lectures are a near word for word recitation of the lecture notes, which are posted on canvas. In addition, the sets (except for the last two) are quite detached from what is presented in class. In addition, the midterm and final will have prac track concepts that were never taught that you should review on your own before hand. </td>
