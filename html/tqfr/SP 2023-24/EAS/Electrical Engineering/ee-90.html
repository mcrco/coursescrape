    <tbody><tr>
      <td>As much as I would love to write a rage-fueled diss track strong enough to fulfill my intensive writing requirement, I need to be fair here. This class does actually have potential. EE45 is the first time we put all of our hard learning into practice, where for the first time you feel like you're actually being an electrical engineer. EE90 solidifies that quite strongly, and there's a lot of satisfaction in ending the term with a working PCB function generator that you designed and built from scratch.<br><br>That being said, there is one glaring issue with this class that MUST be addressed in order for it to have any chance of living up to its potential: Richard Kalantar Ohanian. It is impossible to overstate how bad Richard is at running a class. If he was a world class researcher pumping out patents daily and he had to satisfy his teaching requirements, I'd give the man a pass. But he's here as a lecturer, and is entirely incompetent at it.<br><br>While people have always complained about EE90, I walked into class excited and with a positive impression of Richard. From the first lecture we were greeted with his solid block of text slides, which he read emotionlessly and breaking only for irrelevant tangents about his work in industry. The notes themselves also provided nearly no information useful to our projects. This became very apparent during the first lab, as we had no idea how the design worked and just blindly fidgeted around with the circuit we copied from an uninformative picture on his slides. The highlight of the lab, though, was during the next lecture when he asked us for feedback. After explaining that only the juniors had ever seen a BJT before (which we needed for the lab) during a single lecture from a whole year ago, he dismissed us by saying something to the effect of, "this is knowledge you need to have when you graduate from Caltech, why do you even learn if you're not going to retain the information?"<br><br>It is difficult to accurately convey what the class really felt like, but there are countless examples of how embarrassing the instruction was. From start to finish it was extremely disorganized, with students having a better idea of what was going on than the TAs, who in turn knew more than Richard himself. The TAs, Chase and Hope, did everything in their power to make the class bearable and were the only saving grace of EE90, so this is a reflection on how poorly the class was run by Richard. The class timeline also radically changed halfway through term, when Richard remembered custom PCBs don't have free overnight Amazon Prime shipping. At this point he also told us that instead of working in pairs for the final project we would each have to do it individually. Besides doubling our workload in the already-underunited class, he forgot that twice as many projects meant twice as much money spent on PCBs and components. The rest of term was marred with "budget issues" and him trying to skimp out on buying the components we used to design our boards.<br><br>Our primary method of communication for the class this year was a Discord server, where students would constantly ask questions for circuit debugging or software help. Richard, very confident in his ability, would boldly assert what we were doing wrong without actually having a clue. Instead of explaining how to fix the issue, he'd tell us to look it up online and post the first 5 links that popped up on YouTube. Personally, I did not witness a single instance where Richard solved anyone's problems, and when Chase and Hope weren't available, I had a better experience asking for help from ChatGPT than from Richard Ohanian.<br><br>You would expect that a professor seemingly so uninvested in the class quality would at least be lenient with deadlines. However, even under exceptional circumstances, Richard almost fully refused to grant extensions longer than 24 hours, claiming it would be unfair to the other students. After sending him a paragraph asking for at least 2 extra days on a big assignment, he mysteriously broke this 24-hour policy to give me a full 36-hour extension. He followed up an hour later, probably after deciding to read what I wrote, and gave me 48 hours while explaining that any more than that would certainly be unfair to other students. Extensions are generally a contentious issue and everyone has their own opinion, but I am simply confused at how the maximum length of a fair extension can be determined by the length of the email asking for said extension. Comically, at some point Richard silently updated the syllabus to say, "extensions are not available during third term," but he did not change his real policy whatsoever.<br><br>TL;DR: Don't take this class unless you have to, and if you do, remember to submit your TQFR for writing intensive credit.</td>

      <td>There's a lot of information in the slides that takes a lot of time to get through. It can be difficult to determine what is helpful and what is simply interesting information, but I do think the slides all have interesting information. It is simply a lot to get through. Ohanian believes that we have a lot of information we need to know cold and he is trying to fill us in on all of that, but it's just a lot. It is nice that he wants us to know so much but it is hard to fit all of it in one lecture a week. I do think that it is a good thing he doesn't tell us how to do everything, we are supposed to learn to design circuits and if everything is just given to us, I'm not sure we would get as much experience. It was interesting to use datasheets from companies instead that would inform us of a particular circuit's design.<br> I do think I learned a lot about designing circuits and debugging them on my own. It was frustrating at times because I would have no idea what was going on with a particular issue, and neither would the TAs at times, but I think that even though there were some aspects I was not successful with, I learned to not stress so much about a project not going right. In the process I also learned about alternative solutions to problems and it only made me more interested in how I could design better circuits. After the frustration of the function generator bread boarding (which you should definitely start early just in case you have issues), I did realize I learned a lot, and it is cool to have designed a fun project. The extra credit in the course was also fun! A lot of people found that the function generator worked relatively easily during breadboarding. I did not find this to be entirely the case, but I think trying not to stress about it is key to getting things working better (also if you're just getting stuck, do coarse adjustment lol). This class can also be tough if you're having a hard time with other things outside of class and it's messing with your focus, but just take a break and come back to the assignments when you're feeling better.<br>I think there could be a better middle ground on how much he informs us on the assignments, and how much he leaves to us to discover on our own, but it is obvious that it is a component of the course that needs calibration with each iteration it is offered. I also think the extension policy in the class was pretty funky. Some people had a lot of issues with it. I tried to avoid taking an extension because of it. The PCBs are due by a certain time for them to come back in time, so it makes sense that the PCB would have a hard deadline because of that fact.<br>This year it was also in a very new format, before it used to be that you were entirely on your own (or at least that was my impression), and I think the new format is much better. You get to build components needed for the function generator every week and by the end you assemble the components into the final product. This gives a lot more structure, and makes the function generator a lot more approachable at the end. While it is obvious that you should break up a large project into smaller components and test them before integrating them into your final, larger product, it was cool to see this as a course structure as most experiences in previous classes are one week isolated labs. I liked having more lab experience than 45 beforehand, but it is doable with only 45 I would think. It's different from other classes where you're given a circuit already, you do analysis and choose values. In 90 you need to determine the circuits (which already exist) and do whatever analysis you need (which is less than my previous experiences), but it's only one more step. I think the class improved a lot from the past honestly. They did cut the power board from the project and the spec is very downsized. This made the project become individual mid-way through the term which we were not expecting, but I think it makes sense. It is kind of sad the power board got cut, I think it would've been cool to do, but obviously a lot more work that people in the past found hard to manage (and subsequently why it was removed). I also enjoy designing PCBs, and soldering, so I think it's a fun thing that you get to design a PCB and in finals week, assemble the board.<br></td>

      <td>I think the content of the class is good, just keep in mind that prof Ohanian pushes you to do your own reading rather than pointing out the answer to you, this can be frustrating at times but any good engineer should be expected to do research on their own.</td>

      <td>I came into EE90 expecting to learn circuit/pcb design. For some background, I haven't really taken many circuits-leaning courses, and don't expect to take any after EE90. I thought that this course would give a fundamental understanding of how to go from requirements to circuit design to pcb. In some sense, that's what the course is structured to do. However, Richard Ohanian is possibly the single worst lecturer/instructor I have had at Caltech, and he prevented the course from teaching me these fundamentals. Don't get me wrong- the assignments mostly made sense and both of the TAs were super great. I think all things considered, the project was fundamentally not unreasonable. <br><br>However, Richard was disorganized at best and actively unhelpful at worst. As the term went on, he would on a whim change assignments and their deadlines, one time almost condensing nearly 3 weeks worth of content into one week during midterms week... with about 2 days of notice (it was later extended to 2 weeks, but was still quite unreasonable). Richard was particularly unhelpful in the course discord server. When asked for help, Richard would at best send a link that was maybe a little relevant to the problem, but at times would be completely irrelevant or unhelpful. At worst, he would send completely unhelpful advice, or tell students they should already know the answers to their questions. Some standout examples (among many others):<br><br>- When asked for help calibrating oscilloscope noise, sent a link to a 14 year old video of someone calibrating a completely different oscilloscope model<br>- When asked about why a circuit wasn't working, other students gave useful feedback, while Richard said that the student didn't turn on the power supply (which was obviously not the case from the question asked, and pictures sent). In another similar situation, the only advice given was to clip the leads on the components, which had very little effect on any functionality.<br>- When told we don't remember material from a single EE45 lecture from 1-2 years prior, Richard responded with "why are you taking courses just to forget what you learn".<br><br>One of the worst things about the course though, was that Richard was constantly worried about falling behind schedule, so he would deny nearly every extension request, even for medical/otherwise justified reasons. When he did rarely grant extensions, he would insinuate that the students receiving the extensions would not finish the class as a result of the extension. Then, without any of these extensions, the class fell behind anyways, as Richard hadn't properly planned the timeline to order PCBs and other components! This class felt like it was always falling apart timeline-wise, despite Richard's insistence that the schedule would be reasonable.<br><br>Now, this is the first year where EE90 isn't required for all EE majors. I would say this much: I almost switched to the IS track at the beginning of this year, and this class made me regret that I did not. I truly think the project is good and there's value in the content, but I STRONGLY recommend staying away from this course so long as Richard Ohanian is the instructor. If a better instructor takes over this class, the class would likely then be worth taking.</td>

      <td>In this class you design, breadboard, and PCB a function generator. This year the project was scaled down a lot because 1) labs were introduced to guide us into designing the different parts of the project, 2) midway through the course the project was changed from a partners project to a solo project. Instead of building a 3-waveform function powered off wall power strips, we built a 2-waveform generator (3rd extra credit) that was powered off a power breadboard. This meant we never implemented an AC to DC rectifier or a power PCB, only linear and inverting regulators to convert DC voltage into positive and negative rails. <br><br>The class was structured on a time crunch. Ohanian asserted that the signal board was most difficult and design-heavy part of the project, which was why he made the project solo so everyone could focus on that. We also discussed making the class 12 units because Ohanian expected us to put in 12 hours of work a week…for a 9 unit class. I think the consensus was it's easier to keep the class as 9 units as it is easier to schedule.<br><br>Some pros and cons:<br><br>- Adding labs was very helpful in giving us a design toolbox and preventing us from scrambling to build the whole project at the end of term. The class was well paced.<br>- Extra credit and grading were very generous. If you put in the work, it's an almost garunteed A+.<br>- All PCB costs were handled by the department — we didn't pay a single penny out of pocket.<br>- The restructuring of the class meant we couldn't build the power PCB, but we had time to build and verify our signal (waveform-generating) PCB.<br>- Ohanian is a lecturer, not a professor, with several other jobs, making this class a bit different than your typical lab. During lecture he tried to expose us to as many industry-relevant concepts as possible, so information on how to design the project itself came from links we were supposed to read outside class. He couldn't be there for us in person since he has other obligations, so asking him to help debug things through Discord resulted in generic advice like "did you turn it on", "did you probe it here?", "did you read this link?".<br>- By the nature of the class, you have to design and debug most things by yourself. This could be a pro or a con depending on your previous experience and perspective.<br>- I found the design aspect to be less mathematical and more empiracally based than other design classes. I learned how to put many simple blocks together to fit a lot of requirements, instead of building one complex block to fit less requirements. Other than making small tweaks in SPICE and on my breadboard, most of my time was spent taking data and writing it up for my reports.<br><br>I know people have mixed feelings about this class, but personally I'm pretty satisfied with my experience. I was told to avoid it and that it would make my term too difficult, but I had a relatively chill and fulfilling term in spite of it. In the end, I have a working, fully analog, portfolio-worthy project that I designed top to bottom, and that's pretty neat.<br><br>My time breakdown for each assignment: https://imgur.com/a/GEv7H4z</td>
