    <tbody><tr>
      <td>I will start with the positive aspects of the course.The content of the course was excellent, useful, and well-taught. The material was presented at a good pace, and the posted lecture slides were written clearly.<br><br>Unfortunately, the positive aspects end here, and the negative aspects are plentiful, which should be a theme that is persistent throughout the other TQFRs for this class. So here goes:<br><br>The sets were way too time consuming and difficult. They contained many typos that made it impossible to get a head start on since the questions and code were constantly changed and updated after the sets were released. The grading was also very slow and extremely harsh. A small detail that is left out or is worded unclearly would cost you a large portion of points for that problem. Regrade requests could potentially cause your grade to go down. Extra credit was given for some sets but taken away after the sets were graded. The course staff would ask how long students spend on the sets and see that an average set takes way too long, much longer than expected. However, instead of adjusting the set, they blame the students for lacking the skills necessary for the class and are not receptive at all on feedback. This brings me to the next point.<br><br>Students are treated with little to no respect. The professor's suggestion for people who were struggling in the class is to drop it. Instead of encouraging students, the professor constantly makes the students feel bad and worthless. It was rumored that they wanted mainly grad students in the class, so they do everything they can to make undergrads drop the class. The professor's responses to students' inquiries on Piazza were rude, passive-aggressive, and unhelpful. They would get mad at students for no reason, often when the professor is in the wrong.<br><br>I can write about the negatives all day, but hopefully this illustrates the review of this course. Hopefully, the course staff takes these comments into consideration and do a large overhaul to address these issues. However, given how little reception was given on feedback, the course may remain as is. So if you do decide to take this class, good luck and Godspeed.</td>

      <td>I found the course content to be pretty interesting, and one may learn a lot from it (although a significant portion of the material was already familiar to me). The lectures were generally satisfactory, although there were instances where Professor Gkioxari could have given more time to certain topics requiring more explanation, while I felt that excessive time was devoted to superficial topics.<br><br>Given that this was the first year of the course, it's understandable that there were some bugs and ambiguities in the assignments. However, the grading from the instructors seemed notably strict, even more so than in other previously established courses at Caltech. Several students and I have found this disparity to be unjust, and I believe the course is currently being ARCed. It remains to be seen how the grading will be adjusted.<br><br>Lastly, it is worth mentioning that Professor Gkioxari's demeanor has occasionally come across as brusque/rude, usually only with interactions with undergraduate students. For instance, there have been instances where questions, such as when someone asked about the intuition behind some mathematical expression was dismissed with a quick, "There is no intuition in math," before moving on. (comment omitted by administrator)<br><br>This review is not intended to dissuade prospective students from enrolling in the course. Rather, it serves as a fair warning regarding the professor's approach and the course itself, considering that it was the first year the class was offered.</td>

      <td>Great course content but unreasonable expectations from the students. According to the surveys sent out by the professors, most people estimate the class to be a 15-unit class and the professors are aware of it but unwilling to change anything. The course staff could not be any more rude towards the students in answering their questions regarding course content and logistics.</td>

      <td>I enjoyed the class and its lectures. Both professors' lectures and guest speakers were great. It was a lot of work, but I think I still learned a lot. <br><br>I think the biggest issue with the assignments in this class were the bugs in the assignments, which I understand because it was the first time the class was being offered. However, the majority of my time spent on the second assignment was because I had the old test suite, even though my code was right (spent around 5-6 hours debugging this issue when this was not my fault). I didn't really appreciate the fact that the message being sent to students was that we should drop the class if we spent too long on the first two assignments (especially when a lot of friends and I spent time on issues such as this).<br><br>Finally, assignment 4 was a nightmare because of the amount of work that we were asked to do. This assignment on its own probably took 35+ hours.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>TLDR: STAY. AWAY. <br><br>In my 4 years at Caltech as an undergrad, I have NEVER. EVER. been in a course that so blatantly does not respect students. Not only are the assignments far too long and don't respect our time, not only are the assignments far too convoluted and difficult, but the professor (Georgia) and other course staff (with few exceptions) consistently assume students are out to get them and are consistently disrespectful to students in Piazza and sometimes lecture. <br><br>I'll begin with the assignments. The Sets. THE SETS. To preface, there were no prerequisites in this course, but on Piazza early on we were told "one course in ML (cs156a) and 1000 lines of python written" should have been enough. They were very wrong and frequently changed the goal posts. In my time at Caltech I have never had any course's sets completely destroy my mental health and so blatantly disrespect my time as the sets in this course (Yes, even CS38 was not this bad). I have ample experience with PyTorch, having used it in research since frosh year and in a few internships. I was not prepared for the amount of work these sets were for a 9 unit class. The sets are 2 week long sets. Along with the time set aside for lectures and the weekly assignment, that means we should leave 5 hours per week for these sets, or 10 hours total. From the very start of the class, the time spent surveys were heavily skewed towards spending 20+ hours on sets. One of the later sets had only 10% of students fit within the 10 hour uniting. this course is SEVERELY underunited.<br><br>This brings me to the grading. The grading was very inconsistent throughout the course. My main complaint with grading is the auto-grader. The code we submitted on gradescope was run through an auto-grader which would tell you if it passed or errored. However, if it errored, it would not give you any output to see what went wrong, instead pointing you to contact course staff. When you contact course staff to get some stack traces to debug on your own, though, they would constantly accuse you of trying to get the TAs and instructors to do the work for us and debug our code for us.<br><br>This sort of leads me to my final point. The instructors. Pietro was fine. He had a few lectures that were alright and was very hands-off. Georgia, on the other hand, was very different. To start with the good: She is one of the best lecturers I've had at Caltech. she was very consistent, concise, clear. This is where my compliments stop. It became very clear early on through Piazza that Georgia did not genuinely have the students best interest in mind. Throughout the course, she would consistently have very aggressive comments to students in piazza posts. She would constantly accuse people of using the TAs to debug for them, saying it is not their job to help with debugging and that the students should be better about this. When asked about the length of difficulty of sets, she would constantly tell students that they should drop the course and come back and take the course when they were ready instead of actually looking at the constructive criticism that the sets are HARD, UNFAIR, and LONG. On top of this, there are several examples in piazza of her being passive-aggressive or actually rude to students in public posts. One great example of this is when there was a piazza post about when we would get grades back. It had been approximately 2.5 weeks since the due date at this point for set 1 and drop day was approaching. One student replied stating there is an internal policy in the CMS department that grades should be returned within 2-3 weeks. Georgia responded to this post asking where the policy was listed. The student responded saying it was an internal policy they heard about from talking to professors and other faculty during the recent curriculum talks. Instead of asking other professors about this, like the student recommended, she responded with saying that she did not appreciate the hearsay and thought it was extremely disrespectful and that she does not appreciate the student being the "police". She proceeded to tell the student that they could "do better" and that they were "better than that". Several students reached out to other professors and confirmed this policy DOES exist. More replies from students continued and she held strong on her thoughts and showed she did not have the students best interest in mind. Also, after this incident, they removed the ability to anonymously post to instructors on Piazza, which is an awful way of handling things. On top of this, she was ARC'd over the sets and her behavior and basically ignored the students' concerns in the ARC complaint. Overall, one of the worst experiences with a professor outside of lecture that I have seen at Caltech. </td>

      <td>I came into EE 148 with a pretty big interest in machine learning, and I came out of it with a passion that was killed. Georgia's lectures were great, they were very informative and conveyed in a very proper way. Georgia is very clearly knowledgeable on the topics of machine learning, her knowledge of how her students in the class, however, is absolutely abysmal. <br><br>The prerequisites of this class are pretty vague, meaning a few thousand lines of Python code, and taking some classes in machine learning. Because throughout this class, you'll have to derive the underlying work of many different papers. Which might not be too bad, but I think that if the prerequisites were clearer, I wouldn't have such a hard time in the class. In particular, on the last set, one subpart worth 3 points can literally be one of someone's greatest life's work, but you get absolutely no guidance. Keep in mind we're learning about the bleeding edge of machine learning, stuff that has only come out a few years ago. <br><br>As a feedback survey in Assignment 1, Georgia asked how many hours we spent on it. As a result of the feedback survey, Georgia recommended over 57% of the class to straight up drop the class, and another 20% of the class to reconsider dropping the class. Instead of trying to make machine learning accessible to all and adapt to the level of her students, instead, she says to drop everything. <br><br>When your problem sets take 20+ hours to complete on average, it's only reasonable that they take some time to grade. As a result, no grades were given before add day, which was fair, but there were still no grades by midterms, and our first grades came a week before drop day, leaving everyone a week to drop the class.<br><br>There is absolutely no leniency in this course. You would expect someone who just arrived at Caltech to be understanding and adapt their class based on the class's needs, but Georgia seems to do the polar opposite. There is no curve in the class, and the only thing that showed the slightest bit of empathy was a 2-day extension on a set that took students 60+ hours. <br><br>When students then ask for anything, the TAs and Georgia seem extremely uptight. She makes it seem like it's somehow a novel idea to have your first grades given out before drop day, which is 8 whole weeks into the term. Georgia writes, "We are going to give you grades before the drop day because we love you and respect you and want the best for you."<br><br>Some of the TAs are extremely harsh with grading for no reason at all. They expect you to read their minds when it comes to their phrasing, and when you request a regrade, they will get mad. It's as if it's insulting to them. If everyone in the class is requesting regrade requests, chances are, the problem might just be you for having an unclear question. This might be a hard concept to understand though. <br><br>The entire class staff, from Georgia to the TAs feel as if they've been out of undergrad for years and years. This is true, and probably why they lack empathy with the undergraduate population. When confronted with small clarifying questions on what the questions are asking, or typos and misunderstandings of the assignment, it's not handled well.<br><br>Another hunch of this class is the colab credits. Honestly, there isn't much you can do, as some of the assignments take up hundreds of colab credits, but it's still extremely anxiety-inducing and gives a pretty unfair advantage to students who can use their own GPUs. I think Georgia dislikes students in her class, because when confronted with the idea of using all their colab credits, Georgia says, "You should not need more than the compute that the subscription buys you. If you end up using more than the units that $50 a month gets you, then you are in trouble and you should consider taking the class another year." Which might be valid, but could be conveyed better.<br><br>Overall, if you're in undergrad and want to learn large language models and such, there are many much less stress-inducing ways to get to do the machine learning stuff that you want to do. Instead of spending what seems like a million hours on a math proof of the smallest line in a paper that you have no interest in, you can find code and explanations online. <br><br>I might just be coming off harsh because of the last set, but honestly, the sets probably took 20 hours on average, excluding the last set, which isn't too bad considering you have 2 weeks to do them. I've heard doing ACM 116 might have been a lot more helpful for the last set. I just feel like the lack of empathy from the Teaching Assistants and Georgia made me lose all interest in machine learning. The content of the lectures is very interesting, and my friends who've just audited the class or taken it on pass-fail had a much better time.</td>

The homeworks take a long time, but the bulk of the time isn't actually teaching you much. For example, on the first assignment, I think I spent about an hour writing code that was technically correct, and then several more hours trying to get the provided tests to pass. There are various reasons for this (e.g., they use a global random seed, so if you do a single random operation that they don't or do one out of the order that the solutions do, you'll get a different response), but it's very frustrating. Sometimes the assignment itself asks very vague questions. I think it's one of those things where if you saw the solutions you'd be like "Oh, that makes sense," but it's vague at times.<br>2. sometimes it felt like the instructors would get upset at people easily, e.g., for not understanding things. I think people were afraid to be wrong during lecture, which made it hard to ask questions. </td>

      <td>In the first offering, the homework took a bit longer than expected, but since it's assigned biweekly, it is pretty doable. I spent probably about 15-20 hours per homework.

      <td>This class was a lot. Obviously, it could have been better organized since it was the first time being taught. Notwithstanding, I learned a great deal about various state-of-the-art methods in machine learning research, and it was clear the instructors put a great deal of work into making the class content. The last assignment (diffusion models) was excessively long, in my opinion, and the same or even greater amount of learning could have been achieved if it was compressed ~20-30%. <br><br>Helpful to have familiarity with PyTorch. You'll probably get a lot out of this class if you have some experience in machine learning. <br><br>Grading was strange; sometimes they take points off even when you did exactly what was asked in the question. </td>

This class also encourages you to build valuable skills, including:<br>- reading papers<br>- coming up with and implementing ideas<br>- making alterations to existing code bases<br><br>However, I recommend you only take this class after completing ACM 116 and CS 155, or you will be very lost.

    <tr>
      <td>I was genuinely excited to take this class at first. This quickly turned for the worst. It was immediately clear that the professors had no intention of teaching a undergrad course that aligned the suggested amount of background one should have coming into the course (1 ML class and have written 1000 lines of code). After the first set had been turned in, the professor suggested that 2/3 of the class drop given that they spent over 15/20 hours on the first assignment. Georgia then moved on to suggest that if a class is 9 units it is the students job to try to fit the work into that amount of time, and is not at all her problem to try to make the length of assignments more reasonable. In returning grades for these assignments, the professor lied about when grades would be released and would snap at students on the public forum who dared try to ask or suggest that the time length was unreasonable. The students were punished with 1% an hour for late assignments, but the professors felt that they had to hold themselves to no such similar requirement. The grades for some questions on the sets were completely arbitrary (you had a correct answer but it was not the specific one they wanted) and students would get points off for things that the question simply did not ask for. Trying to ask for a regrade was usually met with a nasty response where you were informed in what way you missed the instruction that was not there. Georgia could not even bring herself to answer all regrade requests on the FIRST set by drop day so no one had any idea where they actually stood in the class by drop day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I would not take this course on grades in its current form. The lectures were great and the material was very interesting. However, the problem sets took significantly longer than the expected time for a 9 unit class (as confirmed by the professor's surveys of the students in the class) and often had unclear wording, which made the expectations difficult to interpret, especially for the coding questions. <br><br>My main issue with this class, however, was not with the problem sets themselves but with the professor and TAs' interaction with students. As mentioned above, the professors made a survey for students after each assignment, but refused to decrease the length of the assignments even after students reported that they were taking much longer than expected for a 9 unit class. In fact, the final assignment was actually the longest one even after all of this feedback. The professors also got ARC:d for the high workload of the class, but refused to do anything to make the class take less time. Instead, they told students to take the class next year when they have more experience and it will take less time. Quite frankly, this is ridiculous considering that the class had many seniors and graduate students who were experiencing the same problems, as the sets were simply too long. <br><br>These comments are in line with an overarching theme in the class, which is that the professors and TAs always seemed to have the worst possible opinion of students and refused to listen to feedback. They did not believe the students when they said that the problem sets were too long and seemed to think that students were attempting to cheat at every possible instance. For example, the Gradescope submission process was difficult to debug, because often tests that passed locally would not pass on Gradescope and the Gradescope test output was not displayed. However, when students asked for help on Piazza, they were accused of trying to cheat and use the TAs to debug their code. One student was accused of trying to act like the "police" when they requested that assignments be graded within two weeks due to a CS department policy they had heard about previously.<br><br>TLDR: This class had very interesting material and lectures, and I really enjoyed learning the concepts taught. However, the professors' and TAs' refusal to listen to legitimate student concerns and feedback and the accusatory nature of their interactions with students made this class very under-united and an unpleasant experience. I really did not enjoy opening the piazza or making comments on it due to the frequent negative responses and assumptions made. I would not take this class again on grades unless there are significant changes in the problem sets and how the class is run, which I doubt will happen based on how it was run this year.</td>

      <td>This is definitely one of the most interesting classes at Caltech in terms of the lecture contents. However, the class is very demanding, especially if you are an undergrad, and the course staff is not understanding at all. There was this one TA who was straight up rude, accusing students PUBLICLY of wanting to get the answers out of her when they were simply asking questions, and the way office hours were organized for this class pretty much made them useless. You are pretty much on your own for these assignments, unless you work with your friends. A lot of people in this class didn't feel much support from the course staff, which I believe is the reason why this class was so hard. But it is an interesting class to take.</td>

      <td>Positive comments:<br>- I learned a ton from this class, probably more than any other class I took this year.<br>- The material covered in the assignments was very interesting: for assignment 1 we implemented an MLP from scratch, for assignment 2 we implemented a ViT and a ResNet, for 3 we implemented nanoGPT, and 4 for we did a lot of math related to diffusion models.<br>- The lectures were engaging and featured great guest speakers.<br>- I felt that the assignments and the weekly paper readings greatly improved my ability to understand ML papers.<br><br>Negative comments:<br>- Some of the assignments were shockingly poorly designed. Assignment 1 was the worst offender in this respect -- it was full of mistakes, including in the code we were given, and contained many instructions which we were told to ignore because they were apparently from older iterations of the assignment. However, all of the assignments contained at least a few major mistakes which caused us to waste a lot of time. This was the first time this class was run, but I don't think that's a good excuse; it's clear that none of the assignments were test-solved or even proofread.<br>- The workload was bad, and it only got worse. Assignments 1 and 2 were quite difficult, made worse by the mistakes. Assignment 4 took me longer than all the previous assignments combined (it was all I worked on for 2 weeks, and I barely finished) and assumed a high level of comfort with probability. Since the assignment was due 2 weeks after drop day, those of us on grades had no choice but to devote all our efforts to it. Furthermore, answers to parts of assignment 4 were basically given away at office hours, and I think the difficulty of the assignment actually caused us to learn much less, as we were focused on just getting through it. The project proposal (a 4-page paper) was due 2 days after assignment 4.<br>- Grading was very variable. There were a lot of ambiguous questions, and some TAs graded more harshly than others. No grades were released at all until a couple of days before drop day!<br>- Students were treated very disrespectfully. This class was theoretically co-taught by Perona and Georgia, but in practice Perona only gave a couple lectures while Georgia was much more active. Unfortunately, Georgia was very rude to students and constantly made excuses / dismissed concerns. This attitude was mirrored by some of the TAs. Students were shamed for asking questions, and constantly told to drop the class. There were multiple instances in office hours where I witnessed other students ask clarifying questions and the TA responded very defensively, accusing them of not wanting to put in effort. There were similar instances on Piazza -- to give just one of several examples, a student posted a very reasonable question, and explained why they were still confused after reading the paper for that assignment. The instructor response was just "read the paper."<br>- All in all, I found it ironic that this class had an unusually harsh late policy and grading policy, while the professors and TAs were themselves extremely late with grading and reluctant to help students.<br><br>For next year, they are planning to introduce hard prerequisites for this class. I'm not sure this is the right move, as I think the class would have been relatively doable if the assignments had fewer mistakes, and more qualified students will probably experience a worse learning-to-tediousness ratio. However, I think if they follow through on getting more TAs it's possible the class will be a much better experience next year.</td>

Thus, I imagine next year the course will run significantly more smoothly. <br><br>That being said, this course teaches an insane amount of material in a very short amount of time. In that sense, the class is very good. However, I felt that the teaching team tended to answer questions in a fairly mean way. Among many other instances, one notable one was questions about bugs in the assignment code were met with "writing code that works is part of the assignment".<br><br>I'm inclined to believe that these comments were, in part, not meant to be mean, but were the result of how new the class was, the complexity of the assignments, and the especially large size of the class. That doesn't excuse rude comments of course, but I expect things to be much smoother next year. This class is really cool, and I think it is worth taking.</td>

      <td>Class definitely requires a lot of ramp up and the help available is not great. Prof can be a bit snarky and condescending and the instruction in term of mistakes in the assignments/tests can be frustrating.</td>

      <td>This is one of my favorite courses I have taken, and covers much of the state-of-the-art in modern ML, including transformers and diffusion models. The lectures from Georgia are excellent and highly informative, and the guest lectures include high-profile ML researchers. The assignments are long and definitely require the two weeks over which they are due, but are doable within a reasonable amount of time. Each week there was a paper reading assignment where we would choose a paper from a given list and write our comments about them on Piazza. There is also a final project proposal at the end, where you write up your own idea for an ML paper - although you do not implement it.<br><br>I do not recommend taking this course before you have taken CS 155 and ACM 116, or have equivalent background/experience. These are very strong prerequisites and the material will be significantly more difficult without them.<br><br>There are a lot of complaints about the course - some of which are valid. The assignments were rough and unclear in some sections - this is because of the novelty of the course and its material, and I suspect that next year's iteration will be much better. </td>

      <td>What on EARTH was this class. It got revamped to make it more relevant and better quality but man oh man was the teaching staff the worst staff I've ever encountered. The content was certainly great and relevant, and I definitely understand transformers/CNNs/diffusion a lot better due to the sets, but the homeworks were eggregious at time given that the TAs were absolutely unhelpful and very rude at OH. Georgia is one of the rudest professors I've ever interacted with - she seemed just angry to be here. Also, there's a project proposal at the end that is 10% of your grade and the grading is absolutely insane depending on the TA. Some TAs are very lenient but others give you very limited feedback and then give u a 55%?? Yeah, I'd take this class if you think you have enough ML background to get by reading slides, papers, and working with friends. Otherwise, don't bother dealing with the negative attitude.</td>

      <td>For a class about LLMs, I was extremely interested just based on the concept alone. <br>Unfortunately, due to extremely long assignments, slow and harsh grading, as well as Piazza being required to do every assignment, I switched to pass fail. <br>Conceptually, the lectures provided useful material but the sets just felt like a painful grind to complete where only upon completion can you reflect upon what you actually learned. <br>Key to the course was also the project proposal, which felt odd given that we weren't actually doing a project but was also graded very harshly for seemingly minor issues (luckily I switched to pass fail by this point).<br>Yet with all the difficulties in the course, the instruction team on Piazza was passive aggressive with remarks with many examples including telling us that finding issues with the assignments (with which there were many) was our responsibility to find and report.<br>Overall, I hope this course will be better in future years given the learnings the teaching team have had this term.<br>Unfortunately for those of us that took it this year, we had to suffer through an annoyingly difficult experience for material that seemed very interesting.</td>

      <td>It's rare to encounter course staff as hostile as this. There was a pervasive sense that they didn't want people to take the class (or rather that they detested the fact that undergrads dared to take the class, even though this is a very typical undergrad course). "Drop the class" was the usual response to any feedback about difficulty at all. Furthermore, at least on one of the assignments, they graded extremely harshly based on unclear criteria, and also incorrectly lowered grades after regrade requests (I personally think that lowering grades from regrades is simply a bad policy, but that's not even the issue here). Another homework was comprised of two full length coding portions along with writing 24 separate proofs from 4 separate papers—a ridiculous time commitment. On yet another homework, the staff retroactively decided that the extra credit was actually part of the real assignment, and I'm not entirely sure if that ever even got fixed. We also went 6 weeks without getting a single grade back. Office hours were generally unhelpful, and sometimes TAs cancelled them for no other reason than busy—if only we could all skip mandatory responsibilities for such a reason. There were also often bizarrely aggressive answers to Piazza questions, and a whole category of issues related to that.<br><br>Honestly people have probably forgotten a greater number of problems about this class than the number of problems other classes even have in the first place.</td>

      <td>Good content, but extremely bad class. This class has been ARCed many times. Georgia met with the ARC reps over 2 times, and her response to each one of those was not to make the class better, but to make a Piazza post about how she "cares" for us. If she does care for her undergrads, then why is her response to someone asking a clarification question about something on her slides "who asked the emotional question again." Why does she tell every student to drop the class when they ask for help? <br><br>The sets of the class were long and hard. First one was manageable, but still very stressful. The second set was also the same. The third set was pretty chill and reasonable for a 9-12 unit class. The last set was atrocious. The average number of pages for that set was 45, and there was one specific question worth 2 points that took up 4 pages. It seemed like on that set they just gave us the questions that they could not figure out themselves. And for this set that took so long, you would think that after all the complaints they would reduce the set size or something. Instead they gave us a 2 day extension but they took away office hours. Some TAs couldn't make it so there was just straight up no office hours. In addition to this, they extended their office hours on ditch day like ??? nobody's even going to be there. Usually on sets they also give us tests to run our code on but the last set they didn't. We had to run a model and describe the outputs (total about 20% of the set) without even knowing if our code was working properly or not. They couldn't bother to put in basic tests. They also would give us extra credit on assignments, and then AFTER grading they would REMOVE the extra credit. They also would switch up the point values of questions again AFTER they graded the set. <br><br>Also in general, Georgia was a pain to deal with. She was so defensive to any criticism she got. <br><br>I took CS124 and I found this class more stressful.</td>

      <td>It was a ton of work (I knew other undergrads who spent 50 hours on the last assignment), but I suppose if you were a grad student in ML it would be familiar to you. The course content is very interesting, and we learn cutting-edge techniques. We also had talks from some of the leading researchers in AI, such as Ross Girshick. I took the class pass-fail so that I wouldn't need to stress as much, and I am very grateful that I did.</td>

      <td>The year I took this course, it was the first year of the LLM curriculum, so I'm not sure how much of this will be relevant. For my year though, the first two assignments particularly had a few issues in the instructions that caused a lot of frustration. If you run into ambiguous instructions or weird problems, just ask in OH or on Piazza, don't waste your time debugging something that turns out to be an instructor error. The fourth assignment was also much harder than the first three assignments and was very math-heavy. Reading through related papers helps a lot with it. You should go to lecture, they're pretty informative, although only somewhat helpful for homework. Make sure to go to OH.</td>
