The difficulty and material were that of a high-school course, the lecture notes were extremely bad, and the homework assignments were boring, repetitive, and at the level of a basic high-school class. Anybody interested in the topic should most definitely go with Ma140 over this course. <br><br>The lecture notes were in the form of Google slides that were very very unorganized, filled with images, and little to no useful information, in fact extracting anything useful out of the slides could've been an assignment.<br><br>The assignments were very easy and uninteresting. With an entire problem set on describing figures (with questions of the form "Do you think the choice of plotting symbols is appropriate" (paraphrasing)), the assignments were just tedious, plug-in work, that did not highlight anything interesting. They were rather disappointing, with the exception of the first homework problem, which for the content covered, seemed to be well-crafter.<br><br>One positive is that the instructors used Piazza, which allows students to anonymously ask questions.<br><br>Overall this was a very very disappointing class, and this comes from a person not interested in statistics and probability, as in I did not have high expectations. This will be an easy grade if that's your primary concern, but if you care about learning and receiving useful information, I would recommend taking Ma140 instead.<br><br></td>

      <td>This course was very badly taught and prepared, in my opinion. It lacked a lot of rigour. I did not attend any of the lectures due to course conflicts, but I can say that the lecture notes were hastily-prepared Google slides that were far from self-contained (e.g.: with screenshots from Wikipedia, graphs that lacked axis titles, an overall lack of flow, few rigourous mathematical definitions (event space was even wrongly defined)). <br><br>The problem sets started off with some somewhat nontrivial counting problems that could fill up a page or two of computation but then went to being HS-esque plug and chug statistics questions. More shockingly, 2 out of the 8 sets (a quarter!) were dominated by questions of the type "Describe this graph. Can you name its variables? Are the axes labelled? Was it nicely chosen?" (yes, I think everyone got full marks. Also, this choice of set presented itself as very inconsistent with the fact that the lecture slides' figures were so badly presented, lacking titles and axis labels, in light of the fact that we were given a whole set on what makes a graph "good", being asked the same 5 questions for a total of 6 graphs). <br><br>The organisation of the course further seemed bad, and the grading scheme is not communicated either. I was hopeful for the Piazza discussions page that was set up by the instructors. However, when I first logged on a little after around the midterm period, I was only faced with the disappointing reality that questions from weeks ago had remained unanswered. Funnily, for questions that were addressed, there were even misunderstandings between the instructor and the TA with regards to the set-up of the problem.<br><br>Probabilities and statistics remain rich and important subjects in mathematics. It is a pity that we did not get more out of this Core course. I hope these issues will be resolved for future students that deserve the education that we did not get.</td>

      <td>Definitely by far the easiest math class I've taken at Caltech. Homework was very straightforward and didn't require too much time, and the exams were also very reasonable. The lectures were pretty useless and didn't always cover everything needed for the homework, but recitation was helpful. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>This class is legitimately a high-school-level course. Not once did I feel challenged. Not once did I feel like I learned anything. Not once did I remotely care about the coursework. Caltech is meant to be an institution that pushes the boundaries and teaches you how to think critically. This class is antithetical to what makes this university great. Every single problem set felt like something that was ripped out of your average statistics course. I was lured in with ideas like 'probability theory' but was massively disappointed by the level at which the course was taught. If you are seeking an A with minimal effort, this is the class for you. If you want to learn something, I would avoid this at all costs. But then again, it is a major requirement for many (like me). So, in that case, I pray that the instructors of this class become brave enough to assign problems that make us think. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>It's a requirement for a lot of majors, so there's really no getting out of it if you have to do it (besides testing out, I guess). It's a relatively easy course, as far as Caltech goes, provided you have some intuition behind statistics (AP Stats). If you don't have that intuition, find a friend that can get you there, go to OH, etc etc, as that intuition can really help you out with the style of problems that are given in this course.</td>

      <td>Probability is a tricky concept because I think often I either get it or I don't, and I don't know if this class necessarily helped me improve my intuition for probability. However, it did introduce me to statistical techniques which I thought was helpful. </td>

      <td>I liked the way the class was taught this year. It was structured in a way that was quite manageable. However, both exams may contain questions that you have to think about a bit more since they may be things that you haven't done on the homework before. You have a dropped set and the grading scheme was 50-25-25 (homework-midterm-final).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The new profs for this class have made it a very fair class. The first problem set was pretty difficult, but the rest of them were on average the right difficulty and took about 5-7 hours each. I would say it's a 9 unit course. The lectures are helpful in learning the concepts and the profs are not too boring like other classes. The midterm was not too bad and the final was great (it had extra credit). There were a couple of extra credit problems on the homeworks as well, which helped a lot. The textbooks were pretty helpful too.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Ma 003 is an interesting class and I really learned quite a bit in the first half of the class. The latter half (stats) was mostly review on stuff I had been doing in more advanced ML classes and some of the homework questions were easily done in python which was nice. Midterm was actually really chill and easy when compared to the homework (which was refreshing and rare in other math classes). The final was a bit tricky and very long but nothing was there to stump or trick students and it was very doable. Both professors were very interested and enthusiastic in what they were teaching and this is the first math class here where I think they took it at a reasonable speed and took time to explain stuff. However, just like all math classes here at Caltech, the attendance probably dropped by like 98% within the first few weeks especially towards the end. Just how it is, and this class was one where I thought me people would go as the lectures where slow and you could understand most everything. Overall, pretty chill class and just right amount of difficulty. The homework was tricky but the midterm/final was much easier than math 2 and other classes. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Overall, pretty chill course. The first half is probability and the second half is statistics. I believe that the first half sets you up well for ACM 116 and then the second half for Ec 122. A couple assignments were on the longer side, but the rest were pretty well planned out.</td>

      <td>Head TA Zhang was amazing. Office hours are very helpful if you get stuck on a problem. The midterm and final are straightforward. The final was harder than the midterm. First half of the course was easier and better organized. Second half seemed a bit rushed.</td>

      <td>This is an enjoyable class about the basics of probability and statistics. Even if you don't have AP Statistics experience, it is pretty easy to pick up the material + there are lots of office hours for extra help if needed. The assignments, midterm, and final are reasonable and related to the material. I'd definitely recommend this course.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>This class is manageable during the first term simply using the textbook, but for the second half of the course the resources are harder to find. I think the grading for the exams is very fair, but some of the sets are graded harshly, perhaps to ensure that you know the material prior to the exams which are a big chunk of your grade.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Gold stars all around!! By FAR the best math class I've taken at Caltech. Incredible teaching that goes at a pace where you can actually internalize the material instead of the "Math Core Classic" - jumping to an incredibly complex problem immediately and losing all chances of having the students understand what's happening.<br><br>I never once felt stupid in this class which is a testament to the instructors making the class accessible and relatable to our fields of study.<br><br>PS are still hard some weeks - I'd definitely recommend OH to make sure you've got the right idea for certain harder problems. Didn't go to rec because I couldn't make the Head TA session - and with lectures and OH I was just fine.</td>

      <td>It's a probability and stats class. It succeeds in achieving exactly what it sets out to do. There wasn't really an "official" textbook until a week or so in to class, which caused some confusion, but once it was clear which books are most helpful to look at the sets were a very reasonable amount of work and the concepts were pretty well explained. OH are helpful. </td>

      <td>This course was not trivial, but pretty easy compared to previous math courses. The lectures I went to were very good, but I stopped going after midterms because I could sleep in and read the slides.
