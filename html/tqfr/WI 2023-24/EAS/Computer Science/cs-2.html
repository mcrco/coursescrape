    <tbody><tr>
      <td>The course is uniquely structured. Lectures are pretty interactive, and Prof. Blank encourages you to answer questions. Lectures are actually pretty helpful to understand the week's lab &amp; project. There's a diagnostic at the end of every lecture on the material taught that day, and you're given a second attempt if you don't pass the first time.  You enter a queue when you go to OH, and are given 8 minutes with a TA at a time before you have to rejoin the queue. You work with a partner in your section on each week's lab. Labs are decently manageable with a TA present to answer any questions. The course material is challenging and a sizeable step-up from CS 1. Expect to spend a few hours each week on difficult debugging. That being said, the material is interesting, and Prof. Blank teaches well. The weekly projects are challenging, but you don't have to complete every single task within the project to meet the pass line.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Take this class if you are VERY COMFORTABLE with java and is a CS major or minor required to take this. To all the MechE's, I wouldn't recommend taking this class too much. Take ACM 11 (6u) and CS 11(3u) instead or even CS 1 if you didn't pass out of that class for the CS requirement. You do learn some data structures and get coding experience, but the diagnostics are such a pain. At least 10 people that I know in the class are at risk of failing as of now due to not receiving 10 diagnostics out of 28 (when on the syllabus it says 30). Hopefully, we all pass. Diagnostics are like quizzes you take at the end of class, and you have second attempts, but the second attempts require 50-word explanations that are graded so strictly and if you miss a small part, you get it wrong. Because Adam does not allow TAs to check your answers and only allows a high-level discussion of your logic, so it felt nearly impossible to get second attempts. The problem is that the people who are not comfortable with the class topic fail the first attempts, but then the second attempts are impossible to get even if it is open collaboration because the TAs don't help, and even your CS major friends can't help because they won't be doing the second attempts since they already got the first attempt right. There are plenty of office hours throughout the week except for Tuesdays (which are lab days), but if these office hours can not help you much, I'm not sure what a student in this class can do to pass when they are not comfortable with the topic. Also just to let you know, the sets took me closer to 7-8 hours on average, and the labs took me around 2-3 hours. I did learn but with so much stressing because I felt unsupported.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>The in-lecture diagnostics were unhelpful at best: writing out code by hand in an environment that doesn't catch syntax errors or allow code testing is not how CS knowledge should be evaluated. Furthermore, having them being done in class takes away valuable lecture time for those that need it. It also doesn't help that the diagnostics are sometimes confusing or near incomprehensible or even wrong (i.e. "which data structure would you use to determine if a character is uppercase or lowercase?" should not have "Binary search tree" as its answer.) The diagnostics don't even meet their purpose of incentivizing people to come to lecture, as if one passes the ten required diagnostics, there is no longer any external incentive to come to lecture. At the same time, the second attempt for diagnostics are completable at home and still count for credit, and, as above, the diagnostics, sometimes, are, as this sentence is, incomprehensible. This is even ignoring that simple errors unrelated to lecture content will cause you to fail the entire diagnostic, with no partial credit. As such, your performance on the diagnostic is legitimately independent of lecture attendance and does not even serve its purpose of incentivizing students to come to lecture. Coming to lecture should be an independent decision of the students based on the quality of the lecture; we are people with agency and should not be forced to suffer through an hour better spent elsewhere.<br><br>On the topic of lectures, CS 2 was slightly better than CS 1, but also a lot of the same. The instructor was somewhat patronizing in lectures and I got the feeling they didn't believe that the students could interact with the abstract topics presented. A majority of the audience participation in lectures felt forced and uncomfortable, while the rest came from a select few people, which created what I felt to be a combative relationship between the instructor and students. If possible, the class environment should be noncombative, if not collaborative.<br><br>The grading policy for this course is, frankly, overengineered. There is no reason it should take nearly two pages to explain how to pass the class, or for floor or ceiling functions to be anywhere in the syllabus. As an example, I was required to get at least one "A", three "B"s, two "C"s, and one "D", as well as at least a "C" on the third, fifth, and seventh projects to pass the class. For several projects, it was impossible to even get a "D", and on the fifth project, it was impossible to get even a "C". When viewed from the perspective of a student that needs to complete these projects, these grading standards make little sense. Furthermore, the way that the projects were graded required students to do two to three times the work to earn an "A" on a project than would be needed to earn a "C" or "D". Thus, the project grading scheme seems to be centered more around how much work one is willing to dedicate to a specific project than a measure of the amount of content you know. The current grading scheme needs to be altered to be simpler, more representative of the course material, and less confusing.<br><br>Several labs in this course were either poorly designed or just not labs. The difficulty scaling on the labs was very inconsistent, and I spent anywhere ranging from 3 minutes to several hours completing the lab assignments. Furthermore, several labs contained no code, but text entry into fields on a page on the course website. On one occasion, the entire morning lab section was stuck for around 20 minutes attempting to solve one section of a lab, and it turned out the automatic grader only accepted the full, written out option listed next to its corresponding letter. This course requires more comprehensive guidance in general.<br><br>There were several classes I found very annoying, in specific the one where the entire class was spent doing the same diagnostic four times. Instructor Blank made the learning environment seem actively hostile on occasion, and in addition to the clear patronization, made lecture something I actively avoided except to do the diagnostic. <br><br>In full, dealing with the idiosyncrasies of instructor Blank and this course in general thoroughly drained my enthusiasm for learning computer science. As a chemistry option who wants to learn computer science because of its potential applications to my intended field, and also, more importantly, because it seems fun and interesting, I found this class to be something I had to force myself through and spend far more time than necessary on, even when I have studied all the course content already.</td>

They put a lot of effort into making this class as fun and streamlined as possible for the students, and though the work load is still non-negligible, I felt that they tried very hard to make it convenient and remove any unnecessary or automatable overhead time and work for students. I would definitely recommend this class if you intend to work in some capacity with programming, even if that is not your intended major: this class will teach you techniques and tools relevant for almost any STEM major.</td>

      <td>CS2 in my experience is not as great as a class as it has been hyped to be from previous years. The class still feels somewhat disorganized with the new diagnostic system (basically end of lecture exit tickets) and the project descriptions are very confusing sometimes. If this is your first term learning Java, this will be a hard class but you should go to office hours. Needless to say, the content in this class and the projects you do are still useful and important things to know, especially if you're a CS student. <br><br>On diagnostics:<br>Many people were forced to drop or failed CS2 this year because they didn't get 10 out of the 30 diagnostics. While I think the diagnostic system can be improved heavily, there is really no reason why you can't get 10 out of 30 when you also get 2 tries as well, especially if you're a CS major. They aren't impossible. <br>DO THE EARLY DIAGNOSTICS. The content at the start of the class is obviously easier so the diagnostics are easier. DO EVERY DIAGNOSTIC until you get the amount you are satisfied with. Many people started "trying" on diagnostics after midterm and had to stress about it or dropped the class, when if they had just tried from the start, they probably wouldn't need to be doing diagnostics after midterm.</td>

      <td>Honestly I can't even blame Professor Blank. After the fiasco of the class of 25', I too would have entered my villain arc. It seems like everything in this class in meant to maximize your suffering. The projects often devolved into reverse engineering the autograder as expectations were not clearly communicated in the spec. In fact, in one project multiple people had to do an entire rewrite because their data structure was TOO EFFICIENT and used an one more field that the autograder wanted (this was not communicated in the project spec). Diagnostics (in class mini-quizzes) were graded on an all or nothing basis, with entire diagnostics failed because you didn't explain your (correct) answer well enough on part 12 of this one point assignment. I've come to believe that CS 2 is simply part of Caltech's master plan to get rid of anyone's desire to sell out to SWE, as any last dying love of SWE you kept as you entered this bastion of theory will be promptly whiffed out by Professor Blank and their CS2 class. </td>

      <td>At the beginning of the course, it's made clear that prior Java knowledge is not needed to succeed in this course, but in my opinion, if you don't have prior Java knowledge coming into CS2, you will definitely struggle keeping up and understanding things (the class doesn't start from the basics, you are kind of thrown into the deep end). Projects are quite hard some weeks (8+ hrs) and lighter in other weeks (2-4 hours), it really depends (there are just a lot of coding tests you need to pass). If you aren't particularly interested in CS or don't intend on majoring/minoring in CS, I'd recommend not taking this class.<br></td>

That being said, the style of the class isn't for everyone. I know multiple people who have switched out of CS/canceled plans to take more CS classes in the future because of this class. 90% of the time you're just implementing function after function from the spec, which is supposed to drill the concepts into you I guess, but can also feel repetitive and unfulfilling. <br><br>As a non-CS major with a decent Java background, I don't think I got that much out of this class. If this isn't a requirement for you, you can check out the course website, https://debuggi.ng/24wi/, to see if the material interests you. I would like to commend Blank and the TAs though. Even though this class wasn't for me, the staff were very helpful and put in a lot of effort to make the class interesting and run smoothly.<br><br>Note: Office hours use a ticketing system, meaning you enter a queue and get helped for a short period of time. It's very helpful to have a dean's tutor/friend in the class to get more extensive help.<br><br>My time breakdown for each assignment: https://imgur.com/a/q4HdsBc</td>
