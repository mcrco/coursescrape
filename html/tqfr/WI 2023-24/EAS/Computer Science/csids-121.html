      <td>I originally came into this class hoping it would be more organized the CS 1, but it was not. Assignments were released late, often revised in the middle of the week, and the codepost dropboxes were opened very late. The topic was interesting, but the disorganization of the class made the class significantly more work than it needed to be. It would be frustrating because we would be encouraged to start the set early, but then people would find errors in the set throughout the week and so people would have to go back and fix a lot of their set. In addition there were 7 problem sets and a final project this year. Halfway through the term, it seemed like there was no way we would be able to finish all 7 sets. We ended up turning in all 7 sets, but it seems like we either won't get feedback on the last couple of assignments and/or won't be able to do a rework.</td>

      <td>Great class to take to learn more about SQL and databases as a whole. A lot of practical assignments. 7 sets and a final project.

      <td>CS 121 was (by a large margin) the most disorganized and poorly-executed class I have ever taken at Caltech. While the course content itself is fairly easy (relational algebra on the first few sets, then basically just brain teasers with SQL queries and DDL setup for the remainder of the sets - I think part of one of our sets was moved to the final and became extra credit) and there's no midterm, the organization and grading practices of the class are quite frustrating. Before discussing the variety of factors which made this class frustrating, I wanted to note that the course content itself felt quite incomplete, especially relative to databases classes taught at other schools. For example, database concurrency is not at all discussed in this class (which seems like an extremely important topic to me), nor is the concept of transaction processing (though it does implicitly come up when building the final project).<br><br>There were no lectures for the first couple of weeks, and by week 4, I had basically no idea when lectures actually were, since the professor would arbitrarily set SEVERAL different lecture times by vote on Discord the night before or morning of. The same happened with OH, making it difficult to get clarification on problem sets. The grading on the problem sets is extremely harsh as well - since this class has "reworks" (which you earn the right to do by completing lecture exit tickets), the graders appear to be instructed to grade harshly to encourage the use of a rework. The issue is that without knowing when lecture is actually occurring, it is impossible to do the exit tickets, and thus impossible to get more than the 2 reworks you initially begin with. This effectively makes your margin for error extremely low on the problem sets unless you camp on the Discord for updates from the professor and have the ability to drop everything at a moment's notice to attend CS 121 lecture. <br><br>Moving on to the Discord - while it was nice to have the professor and the TAs interacting with the students in a forum like Discord, there were many critical course updates which were communicated solely through the Discord in the form of a singular message, which often got lost within the slew of messages sent by students, as well as the other messages the professor themselves sends. This made it difficult to determine basic things such as the deadlines of assignments. <br><br>Finally, the process of receiving grades and feedback from course staff is incredibly slow. I am writing this TQFR over a week after the end of finals week, and I have still not received a final grade for this class - in fact, around half of my assignments are still ungraded as well. Getting questions answered by the professor was also pretty challenging, as I would not receive responses to basic questions for several days. <br><br>If you're interested in taking this class, you'll probably do alright as the content itself isn't very challenging, but be prepared to basically treat this class as a self-study, independent endeavor with limited support from course staff. Also, make sure to start the final project (an implementation of a database of your choice paired with a Python-based CLI or a Node.js webpage) a bit early (probably at least 5 days before the due date) - the amount of tasks which comprise the final project accumulate to a fairly substantial amount of work, and you might have to stay up late writing a lot of code if you put it off too much. </td>

      <td>I took CS 121 instead of CS 4 in my smore year because I wanted to do something interesting. I don't regret that because I personally thought that databases ended up being pretty interesting, but not everyone agrees with that (it depends on the person). I thought relational algebra was borderline useless the first week, but it did teach a couple of important concepts about the way that relations work in SQL. Aside from that, most homework teach useful features within SQL, and you could say that you can just learn SQL on your own outside of a class rather than deal with the annoyances of CS 121, but I'm one of the people who would say that and never actually do it on my own, so I took the class and now I know how to use MySQL. The final project is a good project to have on your resume anyway. Plus, it should be a good grade, and Hovik really cares about people learning in the class.</td>

      <td>The content of the course was interesting and useful (mostly of SQL). The work for this class consisted of 7 assignments and a final project. Students could earn half of a rework token for every lecture attended, which could be used to rework assignments. We were told we could rework assignments twice, but grading was slow and we ended up only being able to rework them once, with many reworks becoming available during finals week. Frequently, brainstorming for the final project was part of the assignments, which slightly lightened the load of the final project. This project was about 30 hours worth of worth of work, which was tough during finals week. Choose a good partner and plan ahead. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>This was a great introduction to database management. There were 7 assignments this year in which one assignment was actually part of the final which I thought was helpful. There was no midterm this year and just one final. The final is a project in which you do with a partner. Choose a partner wisely and start early as making the user interface user friendly takes a lot of effort. If you have taken CS 132, you could create a website as well, but it was not necessary. I did just fine in the class without it. I spent around about 25-30 hours on the final but most of it was debugging python and mySQL.<br><br>I thought that the sets did take time so start early and also make sure to go to office hours to debug as the errors are harding to debug. Some of the sets took longer than others. I did wish that office hours were later in the week or during the weekend since that was when sets were do. <br><br>The one thing that could have been done better this year would be grading. The last few assignments didn't even get released so you had to go to office hours in order to feedback if you needed to do the rework. The grading was released really slowly so you didn't know too much about your grade until students kept asking for the grades to be released.</td>

      <td>I really enjoyed this course, it is one of more "practical" courses where you learn stuff that you will definitely find helpful in the future. I liked learning SQL, it was interesting to learn about databases, although relational algebra was not my favorite topic. The first assignment is a bit long and tedious, but other assignments are definitely more interesting and more programming-based. The final project was my favorite part of the class, it took very long time to integrate everything together, but my partner and I were really happy with our final product. Highly recommend the course.</td>

      <td>As far as I know, most people take this course because they want an easy class. That is what you get, but the course was so disorganized that I was actively stressed about it anyway. <br><br>My biggest issue with this course was the organization and grading. This term, grades came out so late that people were asking about them at the start of Spring term (and so late that the registrar automatically failed some students at first). Even before then, the course gave me a lot of anxiety; El routinely sent essay-length Discord announcements and just made me question what was going on. <br><br>Assignments aren't bad and the course policy included the opportunity to rework them. However, reworks often had to be asked about on Discord to be posted, and later reworks were a struggle to get grades on. Then, the final project specification was not finalized pretty much ever; it was a copy of last year's (with some parts that no longer applied to us) and said the deadline was "Friday +/- 1 day" which resulted in a lot of confusion.<br><br>As a note, most of the content is basic and could be learned from watching a YouTube video. You'll mostly just learn how to write SQL for a term (which, at least if you're a CS major, is really easy). Thankfully, you will learn about relational algebra and entity-relationship (ER) diagrams, but we didn't get to normal forms this year. The final project is decently interesting since you get to write a Python app to interact with a database you design, but that assignment came with its own challenges (as you can see above). <br><br>Overall, this course covers useful content, but it's not worth the headache; you can teach it to yourself in a day. El is accommodating and kind, but they seem to offer extra OH and lectures at the expense of other parts of their courses.</td>

      <td>This course is disappointing to say the least. The topic is interesting and Professor Hovik clearly seems excited about it. Unfortunately, the quality of the course is sub par any course you could find online and complete in the span of 5 hours.<br><br>Starting off with lectures, they were close to non-existent. Professor Hovik really wanted students to attend lecture but they did not bring anything additional to the textbook. The lectures would focus on some past ideas that students would bring up instead of the actual content we, as students, needed to learn. It really felt like wasted time and would discourage anyone from going to lecture. There were a few times that lecture would also be randomly cancelled in the morning because the Professor would not show up which was frustrating as students would be waiting in the classroom and receive a message 2 hours later saying that something had happened. Once is understandable but multiple times made it frustrating.<br><br>The assignments were dull but did the job I guess. The final project was sort of interesting but very poorly distributed over the course of the term. Essentially, students would have to make proposals for projects without knowing the expectations nor the technical feasibility since the content was not covered and then were expected to complete it in the span of finals' week. The project alone required 30+ hours and the fact that some assignments took barely 2 hours made it extremely frustrating to have such a severe time constraint on the final project. Looking back on it, the poor organization of "content" and assignments (deadlines changed weekly and subject to whenever the assignments would get released) made it impossible to start the final project early even though multiple students asked on Discord.<br><br>The grading was terrible. There would be many, many errors throughout the term with deductions that should not be present and errors that would not be caught by the graders. The turn around time for grading was about 2-3 weeks for the assignments and the final project grading is still not completed as we are starting Spring term already. <br><br>In summary, disappointing course that is definitely not Caltech worthy even though it is definitely not hard and the (few) "content" that is in the course is interesting in itself. If you don't need the units, just look up a better course online that will save you many hours and give you more content.</td>
