Going to them is essential to understand the concepts, and he makes them engaging.<br><br>This class is hard and meets up to what you expect from a 12 unit class in terms of workload. There are 6 sets, 3 projects, and 1 final. All of them are difficult and time consuming, but doable. Not many problems felt like busy work. The projects were fun to do, the reports were not (but that's a me problem more than a course problem).<br><br>If there's any issues, its that the sets would frequently be edited slightly a few days before the deadline, but they would not annouce it to the whole class, meaning that there was regular issues of having slightly incorrect versions of template code or typos in problems. Additionally, the sets too much too long to grade (more than a month behind on grades as of now), making it hard to gauge what to study on.<br><br>Overall, I still recommend the course, especially if you're interested in Machine Learning, but make sure you have a good group to carry you through projects. I mean to work with together.</td>

      <td>For the reputation that this course has, the course administration was pretty terrible. Almost every set had typos, mistakes, or otherwise misleading qualities, and the TAs were constantly making changes to the sets even up until the day they was due. And these changes were never announced to the class - you just had to check every Piazza question and see if they changed something, then redownload the set. Speaking of Piazza, the general feedback and support was not very high quality - the average response time was in hours, and most of the time the "instructor answer" was not helpful and could make you even more confused. Plus, the administration changed the course collaboration policy 3 days before the final was due - it originally said that the final exam was open-internet, but then it was changed to say that using the internet was not allowed on the final. The grading was also questionable - many of the grading rubric items looked for specific and arbitrary statements, and you could never really know exactly what a question was asking until you got the set back 3 weeks later with many points taken off. However, the content itself was generally good. Yisong is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot about machine learning that I'm definitely not going to forget. The problem sets are generally long and tedious, but definitely improve your understanding of machine learning.</td>

      <td>For me personally, this class was not worthwhile. The sets have coding question, pure theory conceptual questions, and analysis conceptual questions based on the coding. Not only were the sets long, but a lot of the answers to the analysis questions felt like I was "making them up". Maybe I'm just not a fan of ML, but this class did not seem to encourage my interest. Coding was fine and felt grounded. I would definitely recommend using the lecture recordings and slides as you're working on the set, because a lot of the material felt like information to be recalled rather than concepts that built on top of each other.  </td>

      <td>This is a really interesting class that covers a decent amount of machine learning. It covers neural networks, probabilistic models (HMMs), and lots of decision trees. Unfortunately transformers are not covered but other ML courses here touch on that. The prof explains the concepts quite well and the TAs (go Hongkai!) are all very supportive and respond really quickly. I learned a lot and was overall a great class (HW6 was def challenging, the HMM one, so be wary for that).</td>

      <td>I will definitely hope you never take this course unless it changes a lot in the future.<br><br>This is the worst experience I have ever had in a course!<br><br>(1)The material covered in the course is basic and out-of-date. I don't think I learnt anything new here.<br>(2)The workload is unreasonably large. But many homework problems are ambigous and are completely waste of your time since I dont't think you could gain anything from those HW and projects.<br>(3) TAs are very irresponsible! They rate your HW capriciously and randomly deduct scores even though you are correct. You will be spending a large amount of time writing regrade request and struggle with TAs.</td>

      <td>CS 155 is a really interesting class and Professor Yue is really passionate about the topics and knows so much about all the current models and methods. The lectures towards the end where he talked about new/novel ML techniques he and his team are working on attack different problems is very interesting. <br><br>However, this class is a lot of work and you will be spending 10-15 hours per set at lease if you want to get a score. Also, I don't know if it was this year, but the grading took FOREVER and I don't think we got back problem set 3 or 4 til the last week during finals. They also seem to grade the projects very chill/easy as my group never lost a point and got all the extra credit. However, we did spend quite a bit of time on each of these and each one was 10+ pages so as long as you put in the effort and make sure to write enough for each section you will be fine. The math gets VERY confusing and hard to follow but it's not really too necessary for the sets except ones set toward the end which was a little math heavy. The projects/coding aspect of the assignments are interesting but I possibly feel like this class is falling behind in the material and maybe could be updated to teach more current models/methods. Plus a lot of the math proven/show in lecture is just a simple call in Python so at least it was tough for me to follow and understand when most everything is already implemented for you in some package. Other than that its a good class just will be quite a bit of work and make sure you get a good team to do the reports (we had three people and would divide more into people coding and others writing the report which worked well). I also did not take CS 156a before this class and was just fine and wasn't lost at all. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>CS 155 is a kind of tough course but it seemed to be much more valuable than CS 156a because it didn't focus too much on useless theory. It was more focused on applications of deep learning through the sets and mini projects (which are in groups). The last two sets are the worst by far as a warning. The projects are not too bad with a good group. The final was hard but not terrible. There's no curve but the thresholds are fair enough I guess.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Taking this course for interest, I found the lectures and the actual course content to be quite engaging. At times, some of the homeworks and miniprojects felt like busy work. Feedback was minimal as the first grade was returned immediately after 2/3 of the homeworks were submitted. Posts on the Piazza were rarely answered in a timely manner with TAs picking and choosing which questions to answer. Office hours were rather few for such a large course. After all 6 HWs and 3 miniprojects, I feel as though the course would've been better suited without a final exam or instead another miniproject.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Choose your group wisely. This class can be heavier some weeks than others, but do not start the set late and be prepared for your code to take some time to run. This was a good treatment of methods of supervised/unsupervised learning, and I do recommend the class. Just be prepared to give it some time, and give some thought to how to make your code run more quickly by removing redundant loops and using dynamic programming.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>This class is a lottttttt of work. It definitely increased my interest in ML but I think that's just because the problem sets are interesting to collaborate on and not because of anything that had to do with how the course is structured / the professor. I think I spent 3-4 days a week working on the sets, and the later sets definitely got a lot harder. The miniprojects (3 of them, done in 2-4 person groups) are much more chill compared to the sets and in my opinion way cooler. The content was pretty neat (especially the HMM projects) but do not underestimate how much work the class is.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The projects are fun. Homework is fair but takes quite a bit of time. There's a lot of matrix algebra, especially in the later homeworks, so it's a good chance to familiarize yourself with some of the notation and math you'll see in ML papers. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Take it! Very relevant and interesting. Just make sure you have a good background in probability theory/statistics and linear algebra. You'll get a lot more out of it. There's a lot of notation so this will help a lot. I took it simultaneously with Ma 3 and a lot of concepts that were confusing at the beginning made a lot more sense by the end.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The material is interesting, but the class is a LOT of work. The TAs do not seem to even look at the questions posted on Piazza, as the response rate is insanely slow. Sometimes it takes 4 days for TAs to respond to a question. Some TAs seem unprepared for office hours. The grading for this class is extremely inconsistent. Be prepared to lose points on random rubric things that were unforeseeable. The grading for this class is also extremely slow. Be prepared to wait 4 - 5 weeks for a set grade. Set 6 is extremely difficult. Be prepared and start this set early. I loved the kaggle competition and mini-projects. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Workload is relatively light (first four sets and first two miniprojects) and takes approximately 7 to 9 hours each week. The last two sets and final miniproject raise this class to being accurately united. The last set was very coding heavy, which justified the amount of time taken. However, the fifth set took time, purely based on ensuring all points of the proofs were covered. The material covered was extremely accessible, and I enjoyed Professor Yue's lectures. However, sets were returned almost 3 weeks to a month late, making it harder to incorporate previous feedback (general, as in level of rigor or depth or what points we missed). In most cases, the grading was reasonable. However, some of the grading felt more arbitrary, and this occurs on the more vague questions on the homework. It would have been nice to have more specification on these questions as to what they were looking for. For example, writing out a very specific mathematical expression and explicitly stating something about that expression, instead of a more general mathematical description of the problem. Other than that, this class was good. Do the extra credit on the miniprojects! They are quite helpful. </td>

      <td>This course was pretty fun overall and did a good job of teaching lots of important machine learning concepts. The last set was more difficult that the rest but none of them were too bad and the projects were fine too. My least favorite thing about this course was that the grading was a lot stricter than it needed to be. Some questions were pretty vague but we were meant to figure out an extremely specific answer.</td>
