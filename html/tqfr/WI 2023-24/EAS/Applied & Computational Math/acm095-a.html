      <td>Make sure you go through the lecture notes to get a holistic understanding of the content. I think Ma 2 is a helpful class to have taken before, especially for the diff eq section. I would say that this year because the diff eq part of the class was a little rushed, I felt like I got more out of Ma 2 than I did from this class, although this did focus more on derivations than Ma 2. However, the complex analysis part was definitely treated very well. </td>

      <td>As much as this course wants to be called an applied math class, it is not. Half, if not more, of every problem set was proofs. I lived in OH over the weekends (attending on average 4 hours every week) and I managed to scrape by and learn some stuff, so I'd def recommend OH. Also, if you're taking this class pass-fail, you don't have to worry about the matlab portion of the class as you'll definitely get passing scores without it. Prof Hoffmann was an incredibly engaging and fun lecturer and you should totally take the class with her or Zuev if either of them teach it, I've first-hand loved her lectures and heard good things about Zuev!</td>

      <td>ACM95a can be a challenging course with the amount of information that you receive and the difficulty of the sets. For a mathematically inclined person and for ACM majors, they will thrive and probably enjoy this course more than others. For Mechanical Engineers, this course may be a pain and a bit of a nuisance. There is not a course textbook that Professor Hoffman followed but used the handwritten notes. These notes were good and were packed with a lot of information, but sometimes looked a little cluttered. To best prepare for this course, I believe students should get exposure to complex analysis on their own time through MIT's courseware classes or through YouTube, as sometimes trying to understand the material can take a long time if you're completely new to it. This is not an intuitive course, and there are a lot of new things that redefine things in the real plane. It is imperative that you read the notes fully before doing the set, and then try to understand the proofs of the formulas later. Working with others can help a great, but of course, do attempt it on your own and do your own work.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>This class is hard. Everybody knows it, and if you aren't a grad student or haven't previously learned complex analysis, it's going to be extra hard for you. Good thing is the lectures are very good and helpful for sets. Bad thing is the midterm and final were disproportionally more difficult than the rest of the class, in almost a mean or cruel way. As someone that has little to no previous exposure to the topics covered in class, I feel like having problems on the midterm and final that were not previously covered in the sets makes the tests nearly impossible, especially in the time frame given </td>

Like most courses at Caltech, you should always expect something you've never seen before.</td>

      <td>Pretty good class. Hoffman is a very skilled lecturer who encourages student involvement and answers questions precisely. At the same time, it isn't always necessary to go to lecture because the class uses Zuev's god-tier notes. Grading was quite nitpicky and I learned, nearly too late in the quarter, that attending office hours was necessary for seeing what the graders really wanted.<br><br>The first half of the course covers complex analysis and the second half covers differential equations. I didn't learn anything from the second half (it was all review of Ma 2), but I've already seen one of the theorems from complex analysis cited in one of my engineering classes, which is pretty cool.<br><br>My time breakdown for each assignment: https://imgur.com/a/nlUZWbn</td>

      <td>ACM95a is an interesting course.  I had to take it as part of MechE core, but to be honest, I'm really glad that I did.  You probably know by now that the first half is dedicated to complex analysis, which most people (at least I) did not have a ton of background knowledge for, and then switches to ODEs, which you will be more familiar with from Ma2.  As for complex analysis, it was definitely a bit tricky to try and grasp some of the more advanced concepts, but genuinely, it turned out to be really interesting.  Even if you don't have an intuition for complex numbers, the class presents this material in a very clear and manageable way.  I ended up really understanding and enjoying the complex analysis stuff, perhaps because it was a new field of math that I found pretty cool.  The ODEs part of the course, like I said, will be more familiar, so hopefully that doesn't have too bad of a learning curve associated with it.  <br><br>As for how to best learn in this course, I found it best to both go to lectures and review the lecture notes.  Professor Hoffmann is a phenomenal professor and she really has a lot of enthusiasm about the material she is teaching.  You can very easily walk out of these lectures feeling like you actually learned something new, and that is obviously pretty motivating.  Going to lecture, for me at least, meant that I was keeping myself aware of what we were doing in class, and helped me understand the big picture of what was going on.  In addition, the posted lectures notes for this class are top notch.  They go through everything you need to know in tons of detail and present things in a very organized and coherent fashion.  Reviewing these lecture notes after lectures really helped make sure that I was able to clear up any confusions I had, and the ability to read and revisit these were really key in helping me grasp the material.  They were also extremely useful for the homework sets.  <br><br>As for the workload, you have to remember that the class is listed as a 12 unit class for a reason.  These problems required you to go through the lecture notes and really understand the content, and for me they took lots of thinking to try and figure out.  Of course, that is super rewarding because as you think through the problems, you are actively learning by doing the homework, but that also means that it takes time.  I would usually just block out my Saturday to work just on these sets, so that I could brainstorm and get it done and have the office hours in the evening to clear things up.  So sets were rough, took time, but for a 12 unit course, that was expected.  <br><br>All in all, I found this to definitely be a challenging course, but one that is really interesting and very well organized!  </td>

      <td>If you have ever taken a Zuev course, you will love this class! Prof. Hoffman did not try to fix what was not broken and skillfully integrated Zuev notes and course policies while adding some of her own, such as the additional resources regarding the theory of distributions. I really loved the first half (Complex Analysis) and wish we could have spent more time and/or gone a bit slower and more in depth. The second half though was also quite enjoyable, especially being similar to Ma 2, but with what I personally found to be better instruction. Overall, I would definitely recommend taking this course if you can.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>The content in the first half of this course was extremely difficult to understand, and I still think my grasp of what we learned is lacking. The professor is very nice and kind, but with the complex analysis content that is already hard to understand, this class was quite difficult. I liked the second half alot better (post midterm) and found the final fairly doable. It was a more approachable version of math 2 and the resources provided to learn were helpful. Start the sets early and go to office hours</td>

    <tr>
      <td>The course was basically just a harder version of Zuev's edition. Franca posted Zuev's own notes and followed them exactly (which was honestly a good choice, because Zuev's notes are great), but then made her own sets that were significantly harder than last years and often did not even cover the material in class very well at all. Despite the large number of TAs they were often not great about responding to Piazza posts and a lot of questions went unanswered throughout the entire term. Franca also seemed to never or nearly never check piazza herself. <br>Overall the course was a good introduction to complex analysis, but the second half was just a repeat of math 2 (ODEs) and was not very interesting whatsoever.</td>

      <td>Welp, welcome to ACM95.  If you feel comfortable with your calculus skills, the complex analysis part of the class will be confusing at first, but probably come to make sense.  I definitely learned more about differential equations in this class than Ma2, but that's a low bar.  Attending the review sessions and taking full advantage of the class materials (Zuev's notes!) are the best ways to survive.  When there's Matlab on a set, godspeed.  Find some friends who took ACM11 or did Matlab in their surf and hope y'all figure it out.  Franca is really nice though, and very approachable if you're confused about the material.</td>
