  <table class="tablediv comment-table">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td>I am writing to provide detailed feedback on my experience in the SEC 10 course, with the intention of contributing constructively to the continuous improvement of the program. While I generally do not provide feedback on TQFRs, I believe it is essential to offer a thorough assessment for the benefit of future students enrolled in this section.<br><br>One overarching concern I would like to highlight is the pervasive disorganization within the course structure. In my academic journey, this has been the most disordered course encountered, and addressing this issue is crucial for enhancing the overall quality of future iterations. The grading system, comprising homework, attendance, and presentations, lacks transparency. Until the course's conclusion, only partial homework grades were made available, leaving students, particularly seniors striving for graduation, uninformed about their progress. A more timely and comprehensive feedback system is imperative to alleviate this frustration and promote a more constructive learning environment.<br><br>Furthermore, the feedback process for presentations has been notably disorganized. The initial attempt at individualized feedback involved cumbersome 1:1 meetings, leading to extended wait times. Subsequently, scheduling such meetings during finals week, when many students are departing, further compounds the issue. As a result, I remain unaware of my final grade, reflecting a lack of clarity and communication that detracts from the educational experience.<br><br>Another area of concern pertains to the course workload, which seems disproportionately heavy for a 3-unit class with only 2 hours of weekly instruction. The assignments, including extensive weekly homework and presentation preparations, demand significant time investment. Some assignments, such as a 90-minute YouTube presentation, exceeded reasonable expectations for a 3-unit course. Additionally, certain tasks, like researching the pros and cons of generative AI tools, lacked relevance to the course content, diminishing the overall educational value.<br><br>The content covered in class also raises apprehensions about its practicality for technical presentations. The repetitive nature of exercises, with minimal variations, provides limited opportunities for genuine learning and skill development. The insufficient time allocated for presentation preparation, coupled with the insertion of unrelated tasks, fosters an environment that does not contribute effectively to technical presentation skills development.<br><br>As SEC 10 is a core requirement, it is imperative that the aforementioned concerns be addressed to ensure a meaningful learning experience. Without these adjustments, the course risks becoming an obligatory box to check rather than a valuable opportunity for skill enhancement. I believe that with improvements in organization, feedback mechanisms, and content relevance, the SEC 10 course can better fulfill its role in fostering technical presentation skills.</td>

      <td>Extremely unorganized and unforgiving class. The prof emphasizes negative feedback so you might even get worse from feeling bad about yourself.

      <td>SEC 13 heavily depends on the professor. Tina Austin is NOT a good professor and I'd highly advise against taking SEC 13 with her. In case you do have to take SEC 13 with her, I'd say just suffer through it... don't get on her bad side because it's not worth it, but also don't try to be a suck-up, because that's cringe. You'll pass and get a good grade if you show up most of the time and do all the regular assignments — don't feel the need to do the extra credit or go out of your way for your presentations. Maybe you will actually improve your presentation skills...</td>

      <td>Avoid taking the course with Tina Austin. If you do have to, expect one of the worst course experiences at Caltech. Do not expect any of the grading rubric to be used in grading. Grades will be entirely arbitrary and she ignores questions about why things are graded in certain ways. She also stopped grading everything about half way through the course. It is almost impossible to get her to respond to an email. For a presentation, she said props were optional. When students did not bring props she spent the entire class complaining about how no one brought props. You are technically allowed to miss quite a few classes, but if you miss one you will likely miss out on an assignment which no matter how many emails you send you cannot get any feedback or clarification even if it is necessary for the assignment.</td>

      <td>The quality of the course depends strongly on the professor. I would not recommend any student take this course with Tina Austin; it was one of the worst classes I've taken at caltech.<br>The professor would not give us feedback on our presentations outside of 1 on 1 scheduled in person meetings (that she often was &gt; 30 minutes late to). I for one never received ANY presentation feedback because the idea of being alone with the prof made me uncomfortable.<br>We were usually given one day off per week to complete homework. The homeworks however usually took more than 1 hour to complete, making this class underunited. Any presentation preparation -- research, putting together slides, scripting, practicing, etc -- was not considered part of the assigned homework, even though it was obviously expected of us.<br>We had no idea how we were doing grade-wise in the class until the last week. Each homework was a different amount of points, and we had no idea how much the points were actually worth in terms of our overall grade. She would only tell us how our grades were calculated in, again, 1 on 1 meetings (she said explicitly she would not discuss grades over email). I'm pretty sure they were based on pure vibes.<br>The in class activities were pretty bad. We would be given 5-10 minutes to research and prepare presentations. When given feedback that this is stressful and not helpful, she responded with an anecdote about how that's the way industry is, saying that she would have to present research hours to days after obtaining data. This ignores that having multiple hours or a day to prepare for a presentation is different than a few minutes, and that those examples involve presenting on a topic you're already intimately familiar with.<br>The lectures (of which there were not many, as most classes were presentations or activities) were ok. They were a bit disorganized, and it's hard to know what I was supposed to take away. We talked about presentation style and speaker voice/body language, which were kind of helpful, but IMO didn't go much deeper than the average "how to present well" results on Google.<br>Overall, do not take this class with Tina Austin.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Generally not too bad, but our professor this term, Tina Austin, made this class harder than it usually is. I've heard that in past terms, the expectation for this class (being 3 units) is either 3 hours of lecture a week or 2 hours of lecture + 1 hour outside of class to prepare a presentation. Professor Austin generally expected 2 hours of lecture + time spent preparing a presentation + an outside of class assignment which had multiple parts and was sometimes quite tedious. The content was not super well-organized and she was pretty anal about deadlines and enforced some pretty odd requirements / procedures, i.e. 1-on-1 feedback meetings which could have easily been an email, bringing props to a presentation without communicating it as a requirement initially, forcing a single person / pair to demonstrate an in-class exercise and then criticizing them in front of the class. Would be a great class with a little bit better organization and a little bit chiller of a prof. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I would strongly recommend taking SEC10 with a different professor, as this iteration wasn't very good. This course is 3 units but it felt underunited. The lectures weren't great and essentially gave us advice like "project your voice" and "use hand gestures", which most of us already know about and weren't very helpful. We had homework each week assigned on Wednesday night/Thursday morning that was due Friday noon that weren't related to the lectures and required us to often record presentations that we hadn't even covered besides vaguely mentioning them in class. We gave presentations in class and gave each other feedback through Google Forms, and the professor would just show us each others' feedback during the one time she had mandatory office hours, where most of us showed up and then just waited the whole time. The homeworks were graded, but none of our presentations were graded until the final grade came out. I would like to say that the professor was trying, but this class was just very disorganized and not great.</td>

This is a course about presentations but I'm sorry if you don't know how to make a presentation by senior year, it's honestly a miracle you got this far. <br>tldr 1; make this course frosh year<br>Secondly, everything was so unclear for the course, we honestly had no idea what was going on at anytime. A lot of the assignments, we went in blind hoping that we were doing the right format. <br>Thirdly, the syllabus, especially the grading scheme kept changing throughout the quarter. Attendance credit was always uneven and we had no idea that the last few days would count for so much points. The best way to fix this is perhaps miss a max of 2-3 classes for the first 8 weeks, then attend 3 TED talk sessions (so give feedback on 15ish people). This would allow students returning home early a way to make up their credit.<br>Finally, I think this class is such a great opportunity to make speaking skills better, but I felt a lot of the assignments didn't really help this. This class ought to be taught to freshman instead, but until that change happens, I think less emphasis on assignments like the chalk talk or personal story is important and more emphasis on small technical talks during each class session. This way, the class (which was underunited) could eliminate the homeworks which take up a significant amount of time.<br><br>tldr; mixed feelings on class, changes need to be made on a larger scale to make class more useful to students. MAKE SEC 10 A FIRST YEAR CLASS!</td>

      <td>If you're taking SEC 10, it's probably because you have to. That being said, this class iteration was terrible, and I would highly recommend avoiding this professor. <br><br>It was Professor Austin's first term teaching at Caltech, but this course was incredibly disorganized, underunited, and all-around unenjoyable. In addition to 2 hours of class per week and 4 major presentations, we were asked to complete weekly assignments that took well over an hour (and often required preparing and presenting a new presentation). There were very few actual lectures, with most non-presentation classes consisting of poorly designed activities.<br><br>Also, there was no indication of how we were doing in the class during the term. Assignments varied wildly in points, and occasionally you couldn't complete part of an assignment if you were absent from class. We also got no feedback outside of "optional" 1:1 meetings, even though we had to fill out feedback forms for our classmates during every presentation. We were also told to schedule 1:1s to discuss our final grade, as she said she wouldn't be entering the rest of our grades on Canvas; most of us did well, but I still don't know how our grades were calculated.<br><br>Overall, I have never heard of an iteration of SEC 10 being as widely disliked as this one. If you have the option, pick another prof. (If you don't, you'll be fine, it'll just suck and you'll probably come out of the class having learned nothing about what makes a good presentation.) </td>

      <td>I know this class is a requirement, and people don't do see TQFRs for this, but if you ever see this TQFR, PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR TINA AUSTIN. Drop the section and take it another term, because I don't think the pain is worth it. It is an excessive amount of work with no feedback, grades, and you will spend the term anxious about whether you are getting an A, B, C, D or even failing since the points for homeoworks are arbitary (HW week 1 can be worth 5 points, then HW 2 can be worth 45 but you don't know it until you get to HW 2 so you doing well on HW 1 doesn't mean anything). <br><br>Just trust me, and avoid this class with Professor Austin, it is just not worth the stress, pain and effort, and 6 hours of homeowork each week that is offered. <br><br></td>

      <td>Just take the class cuz you probably have to; it sort of helped that I knew people in the class which made in-class activities tolerable. Overall, I feel like I learned very little from this class though, and the only helpful feedback I gained was from peer reviews and not from the professor. Prof. Austin did little to help clearly structure the class and did not create a welcoming learning environment in general; on multiple occasions, she would modify presentation rubric and structure on the fly, putting early presenters at a clear disadvantage and not spelling out clear grading policies for assignments from the start. At the start of several lectures, we were told we would have extra credit applied if we asked questions and participated throughout class yet would not keep track of such participation, and I am sure that she did not account for it in final grades.<br><br>tl;dr you probably have to take the class but do yourself a favor and try to not take it with Prof. Austin.</td>
