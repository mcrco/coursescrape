      <td>It was very frustrating that we would require notes from the lectures to finish sets, but then none of the notes would ever be posted. It's currently my conspiracy theory that they were not posted on purpose so that people would be forced to attend lecture. Lectures would be weeks apart from the sets, making it harder to remember relevant information. I had to refer to notes from prior years' website in order to even finish some projects.<br><br>I was not a fan of the "lecturcises" that only seemed there to make people attend lecture, make up a huge portion of your grade, and were graded very harshly.<br><br>There is no way to know your grade in the class because half the projects have a section where the TAs will manually grade your work, but they don't tell you what the grades are. TAs would also frequently completely ignore questions posted on Ed in regards to missing lecture notes or questions about grades.<br><br>Overall, the class content was still good and I feel prepared for future OS classes, and the projects were well designed for the purposes of the class. The lectures were good, although sometimes strangely paced. It wasn't exactly my favorite class, but I'm still satisfied with its content despite some frustrations.</td>

      <td>This class has definitely been my favorite class at Caltech so far. I didn't realize I was interested in systems engineering until taking this class. Blank is a great lecturer and all the concepts are explained very well by them. The lectures also usually provide the answers to the problem sets, as we discuss the implementations in class most of the time (malloc, threads, compiler and so on). Additionally, all the projects are very interesting and being able to understand how your OS manages every task that happens on your PC is very rewarding. I found all the assignments to be similar in difficulty except the Midterm, which I found more challenging conceptual wise than the other projects. (malloc and the BASIC to assembly compiler were definitely my favorite projects, look forward to those!). The only downside to the class were the lecturcises :( Those were open ended questions that we had to answer every week and most of the times, it wasn't very clear what they were looking for in our answers. But overall, awesome class, I learned a lot</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The main thing I have discovered from this course is that Blank is not a good lecturer. Never, until this course, have I gone to a lecture and thought to myself, "I wish I did not go". Usually there is something to be gained, something interesting, even if its not related to the course material. However, Blank's lectures are so inefficient, that they take an hour to explain concepts that could honestly be explained in 5 minutes. One lecture, they dedicated 30 minutes to working on a Lecturcise (just a fancy name for open an open ended question) that boiled down to writing like 6 lines of code, none of which were even conceptually challenging.<br><br>And about the Lecturcises. They are 30 percent of the grade. These turn CS24 from a class where the people who go want to learn, and thus will not ask the same question 5 times, to a class akin to Ch 1a, where people will just not pay attention until Blank states "This is a Lecturcise", upon which at least 10 minutes will be spend for people to get the answer according to Blank's exact specifications. After all, if you did not answer it how Blank wanted it answered, did you answer at all? The rule with Lecturcise is you are allowed to get as much help as needed during the lecture, but after lecture finishes you're on your own. Lecture notes? There are none. Miss lecture? Too bad. Blank's goal is to get you to sit down for three hours a week listening to the most inefficient handling of genuinely interesting material so they can pat themselves on the back and say, "People are going to lecture, so I must be doing it properly". No it isn't. Make me come by giving good lectures, not by holding my grade at gunpoint. Otherwise, just do flipped learning, as that obviously seems more up your alley. For all fairness, I will note I believe Blank's previous late token policy to be good (where you got late tokens for answering questions handed out in class), as while it incentivizes going to lecture, it does so in a way that helps people who need it while not really hindering those who don't. Just go back to that. Or just actually teach material, that works too.</td>

      <td>The material is interesting. The textbook for the course is very thorough, concise, and clear. I would highly recommend using that as a supplement to make sure you understand the concepts discussed in lecture (https://diveintosystems.org/singlepage/). <br><br>The projects took me &gt;15 hours without exception every week. The course is severely underunitted, but as its a requirement for both CS majors and minors, just plan on taking a lighter term otherwise. Try to go to as many office hours as you can in general, but especially early on in the week. You will need help on nearly every task of each project, whether that be debugging or understanding what the spec is actually asking you to do. The TAs are wonderful but there are only so many hours in the day for them to help everyone so use the office hours as effectively as you can. </td>

Prof. Blank walk into Office hours and randomly start berating and swearing at their TAs just because they aren't following whatever half-baked OH scheme they cooked up that week. Furthermore, have fun ever asking Prof. Blank questions on course material, every time I've asked they talk down to me and act like I'm somehow asking the dumbest question ever conceived; it's not like I don't understand course-material. I've cross-compiled my own OS and designed several programming languages in ARM32 assembly, therefore I have a pretty decent background in these topics. But, Prof. Blank feels like they must talk down to you. DONT TAKE THIS COURSE IF U DONT NEED TO. It takes interesting topics in low level computing and makes them miserable. fini</td>

      <td>Love it or hate it, 24 is 24 and an integral part of the CS option requirements. I don't believe that the class was as difficult as people had hyped it up to be, however, at times it did take a significant amount of time to complete some of the assignments (over 9 hours for a couple of projects), and was generally an interesting class in terms of projects and definitely nontrivial.<br><br>I think that the class was in some regards poorly organized/structured. One thing that made its debut this year was exercises meant to be done in lecture as a kind of pulse check. It was going well for the first few weeks and it was as promised where it was discussed in lecture well and submitting that basically got full credit. However, as time dragged on, some of them were rushed and poorly explained in lecture, and later on some of the concepts for them were touched on in class before moving on. Meanwhile, the grading rubric for them had become increasingly harsh and in order to receive full marks, one would have to include several 'keywords' or concepts which although related to what the question was asking or need to explain some parts of it in surprising depth given what the question was asking. As such, the grading rubric felt arbitrary and didn't reflect what students actually understood. Given the nature of these supposedly being "just a pulse check" and testing a little bit of conceptual understanding, it felt unnecessary how harsh these were graded in addition to it being part of a whopping 30% of the final grade in the class.<br><br>Additionally, throughout the term, on the course website, there were supposed to be readings and lecture slides to be posted to at least partially match what was done in lecture. However, past mid-October (note: about 3-4 weeks in), the only thing that was posted was one code example which was quite frankly absolutely necessary in order to complete the project (if one where to try to look up how to use signal.h / asm instructions to do so, they would never find this way otherwise) which was also posted relatively late in the week. It seems like it wouldn't be much effort to do so, especially given that most of the materials is the same as previous years, however, it was never done. Furthermore, the instructor had mentioned that they hadn't posted the slides intentionally, as they were upset that students that were going to lecture "weren't paying attention" and asking the same questions (perhaps they genuinely didn't get it or they were asking several clarifying questions on the same topic to get a better idea of what was expected to be written for the lecture exercises). Regardless of whether the students were paying attention, not posting slides for this reason seemed unprofessional to me, and although the readings were unintentionally not posted, it shouldn't have slipped past for that long.<br><br>As a final note, to this class's credit, it has a ridiculous number of office hours (something like &gt;36-40 man-hours per week). However, usually office hours are crowded and it takes a while (35mins-1.5hrs) to get to the front of the queue and finally get help. In spite of all these hours, they're all clustered right before the due date, which wasn't helpful to me, as due to deadlines in other classes, I would more or less have to finish CS 24 early in the week, and hence, without office hours.</td>

      <td>CS 24 is a difficult course, but it has a ton of office hours that are very helpful. It's a camp-OH sort of class. Lectures were pretty much required this year because lecture slides weren't posted after the first few weeks, so you had no clue what was going on otherwise. The midterm exam was super difficult since a lot of it was not covered in lecture.</td>

      <td>In this class, you have 2 options each week. (1) Either wait till the deadline and do the assignment with the help of a friend who has finished and a trusty late token, or (2) start early and work all week to finish before the deadline. When we are taking many other classes with weekly sets, the second option becomes unmanageable, which makes this course difficult. Otherwise, the material is interesting and is taught well. But within the context of the Caltech course load, this is unbearable and stress-inducing. Furthermore, hopefully, you have ways to cope and mental health check-ins with yourself.</td>

      <td>pretty ez class, very chill (although time heavy be ready to debug on malloc) but management is not great. for some reason the lecture slides were not posted??? I guess to encourage class attendance and focus but this really only applied to a few select individuals (who frankly a lot of us could probably name) and for the rest of us it made the material hard to consolidate. lecturecises were fine although what was expected was not particularly clear- I do think this was better than having more open questions in the problem sets though. I didn't attend office hours because I needed to get the sets done early in the week and for whatever reason the OH times were always geared towards the deadline. Also OH waiting times were intolerable, hours at a time and you had to be there waiting the whole time. It was frustrating to see people camp at OH and queue without proper questions. An appointment system would be good. Maybe make the pretest an actual pretest to check if people's coding level is up to par? Although honestly I don't think I needed CS 3 for this class and Adam should get rid of all pre requisites (proof by pre test!). <br><br>Bref, this is a very interesting class. Worth taking if there's any interest (not that this makes a difference, most people are taking it uniquely for the major). The way its run though could use some work... I really enjoyed it (probably my favorite class this term) because I didn't interact much with the OH system and was able to do things on my own for the most part, but my friends who did need OH help debugging and had more trouble with the material enjoyed this class much much less. <br><br>  </td>

      <td>This course takes an insane amount of time each week. Like ~15 hours a week regularly. If you mess up one assignment your grade instantly drops and you can't get higher than an A-. If you mess up 2 assignments, it's actually over for your GPA. There is some extra credit but it is a level of difficulty harder than the assignments. You don't know what your grade is though until the end. Lecturcises are graded very harshly and are a large chunk of your grade. </td>

      <td>This class, depending on the week, may or may not take up a large part of your schedule. CS24 is a rigorous class (not as rigorous as CS 21), but this was probably the most involved programming class.<br><br>Unlike CS 2 and CS 3, where if one knows enough about the concept they can do well, CS 24 projects do require a somewhat thorough understanding of the conceptual material. Make sure to start projects early, as office hours can get quite full. In office hours, while I was in the queue for a longer time, I did spend most of my time debugging the problems I sought out to fix anyway. <br><br>Make sure you know what you are doing in terms of the project. TAs can give different advice for the same issue, so make sure you know what works for your implementation.<br><br>Make sure to attend lecture. This year, the course implemented "Lecturecises", which are in class questions given out by Adam at any point during the class. There is unlimited TA help on them during class, but once class is over, these become non-collaboration. However, there are few TAs for a very large classroom, so not everyone gets their question answered. While more time was spent in the beginning of year for lecturecises, there was less time spent on it, and the entire question was not fully given away in lecture, leaving students to figure it out for their own. The textbook was a good resource to understand the concepts though, so do utilize it when you need to. Lecturecises are worth 30% of your grade, so if you get a question wrong, you lose 1.3% of your grade (I think). <br><br>To answer a lecturecise, sometimes we have to look at notes from a prior year (Adam allowed this), because the notes were not put up on the website, starting from Week 3.<br><br>Concepts felt a little more rushed near the end, but the textbook was helpful for clearing such doubts.<br><br>Concepts are equally, if not more, important than the actually programming component, so make sure to stay caught up.<br><br>Overall, a very good class. I got much from it, albeit being one of my more difficult classes this quarter.<br><br>The time breakdown is here - https://imgur.com/66ozIE6</td>

However, I feel like Blank genuinely cares about how well his students learn, and I'm sure they're cooking up better course policies for next year. Note for students: read the textbooks!! (Dive Into Systems &amp; Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces). If you read these textbooks, you will have a better understanding of the material than 95% of the class.</td>

      <td>I have never been so dissatisfied with a course and an instructor in my life. While computer systems are interesting and some of the assignments were great, there were times I asked myself, "why are we doing this?". For a course that is a 10-week survey on computer systems topics - VMs, compilers, security, memory allocation, and virtual memory, we spent far too much time on cybersecurity topics at the expense of more applicable general knowledge. I came out of this class without feeling that I particularly know how operating systems work, which I am thoroughly disappointed about.<br><br>To get to the real issue of this class - the instructor. Adam, while enthusiastic, caters to student questions during lecture that clearly build off the topics at hand in a way that is beyond the scope of the class. This severely limits the ability for students who still need to grasp the basic course topics and cuts down on total lecture time by 5-10%. While those students who are far ahead of first-time learners should be supported and have their questions asked, lecture is not the time to do so when those questions are beyond the scope of the course content. Because Adam caters to this, lectures tend to run behind and not as much is covered as should be.<br><br>Usually, when a professor has a dedicated course website and pre-made lecture slides, that professor will post lecture slides to the course website for all students to see. Well, that was not the case this year, as Adam Blank refused to publish or send out lecture slides to "punish" those students who did not attend lecture. This clearly affected everyone, since even students who attend lectures use slides as a reference when doing assignments. Moreover, when individual students approached Adam and asked them to post slides, Adam responded with "I'm too sick". As turns out at the end of the term, this was not the case and Adam deliberately lied to students about why lecture slides were not being posted. This is by far the most embarrassingly childish display of ego that I have witnessed at this school, something I expect the likes of middle schoolers to do. Because of arrogance and a ridiculous craving for power, Adam affected the learning outcomes of an entire class of CS majors to get back at a subset of students that didn't come to lectures. I can't believe that at one of the nation's top institutions, we have professors instilling collective punishment and lying to students about the unavailability of learning resources.</td>

      <td>I thought this was a really interesting course overall and I learned a lot. The best part of the course was the projects; they all were things you could look back at and feel like you accomplished something cool. The projects themselves weren't too difficult with regards to the code you had to write, but if you made a small mistake then debugging could take a very long time. For components of projects with no test, it was hard to figure out what grade you got. One big downside to the class was the professor. They stopped posting the lecture notes completely after a few weeks, so we couldn't review the material or see the associated readings with each lecture. In the last lecture, they essentially said that they stopped posting the lecture notes because they were upset that people stopped going to lecture and were not paying attention when they did go. I don't know why they wanted to disadvantage the whole class because of this.</td>

My advice is to take this class early so that you can drop the CS major if you find this class too hard.</td>
