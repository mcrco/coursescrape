      <td>Disclaimers: Frosh on P/F, course currently gives 70 drop points which will be changing in the coming years, had previous experience with proofs from FSRI Math.<br><br>I think this is an AMAZING class. Sure there were easier offerings that filled the same requirements this year, but this class really makes sure you understand how to do proofs and exactly what is expected of a good proof. The class also mixes in some extremely interesting topics from the field of CS and the proofs behind them. You get to see exactly why certain processes work, and Adam isn't afraid to argue with you on why something works even if it doesn't seem like it does. Adam cares a lot about each of their students and is very dedicated to making sure you understand the content as much as possible. They and their team of TAs aren't afraid to admit when they mess up either. They will make it up if they genuinely messed up on their end.<br><br>Use grading requests sparingly. If you genuinely think that they just mismarked a rubric item, request one. If you are asking for pity points, you are going to get denied, which is to be expected. <br><br>Attend every lecture. You really will benefit from EVERY lecture and learn some fun things along the way.</td>

      <td>I took the class as a frosh. In the first weeks, I personally struggled a lot with the course. I neither did Math 0 nor had any proof writing experience. But, as weeks went by, I got better because of the important course handouts and attending all the lectures. So far, I think Adam Blank is the best professor on campus. Prof Blank cares about students and delivers content in a very enjoyable/understandable manner. In addition, attending lecture was helped me alot. The sets were not easy, I spent alot of time on them, but they are manageable and really fun when you understand what you doing. The TAs were so helpful too specially Yakov and Nico. I recommend this class for anyone interested in CS.</td>

      <td>To those who have the option between Ma6a and CS13 I'd recommend Ma6a over this course. From what I've heard from students who chose that class over CS13 their workload was much less and they likely learned just as much. Sets would take me multiple hours straight with office hours to complete, let alone to get a decent enough grade that it wouldn't be an absolute GPA tanker. Adam was a very passionate lecturer and they very clearly enjoyed teaching the class, but the assignments asked too much of the students' time for a 9 unit course when on grades. On P/F I'm sure the class isn't too bad, but on grades it became the only class I felt I could work on most weeks.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Most likely you will be in CS13 to fulfill the math requirement for the CS major.....and, if you are a freshman thinking about taking it, I highly recommend it because the passing requirements are pretty light and its a good class to take. I have never been a fan of the proof/math side of CS but this class does teach these details and topics at a much friendlier level and highly recommend over 6a if you are a CS major. Also, this year, they had 70 drop points which I think they should keep because it give you a little cushion for their harsher then average grading.....like I took 21 last year and would get some partial credit usually on my proofs. However, in CS 13, they would just keep knocking off points until you hit 0...which was kinda frustrating spending alot of time on the problem but that is where the drop points did come in helpful. Also, dropping the final and last set was SO SO nice and hope they keep this structure in future years. Expect to put in about 4-6 hours total per week on assignments and more if you really want that high A. Overall, a solid class and interesting if you like the math and proof side of CS, I just wasn't a huge fan of it but made it through and learned good proof writing techniques that will help in future classes like CS 38</td>

      <td>If you are considering this course in place of Ma 6 for the major or the minor, I think this course has extremely interesting material, and is especially useful for CS. The coding assignments are fun and a good boost, something you wouldn't see in Ma 6. Additionally, I think there's a good exposure to proofs and proof techniques in this class, which make it worth it. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Prof Blank markets CS13 as "what someone is actually supposed to learn for discrete math" as well as its emphasis on teaching you how to write correct proofs. At some point, it felt like the course became nothing but a very brief survey of parts of discrete math with assignments that emphasized correctness of proof writing rather than concept (not saying that's necessarily a bad thing though). I don't think you'll actually learn much of anything in discrete math from this class compared to something like Ma6a. Assignments themselves were reasonable and the course staff did a fantastic job making deadlines manageable and providing help in office hours. It just felt that at some point, we had moved away from learning anything important and were just proving things for some esoteric homework set. I can't actually say I really learned anything beyond a very topical survey of discrete math. That is somewhat disappointing. <br><br>If you're required to take this class, it's fine. I'm not sure what it's like concurrently with something like CS24. As someone who already took CS21, as long as that class doesn't fundamentally change, CS13 is not going to pay any real dividends there. For those who have a choice, I'd recommend weighing how much you want to actually learn about in discrete math, how miserable Ma6 is any given year, and whether you feel you actually need help proof writing. </td>

      <td>This was the second time this course was run and hence it was slightly disorganized. I felt like I learned a lot but sets took &gt;10 hours every week. Sets came out quite late because they were still finalizing them and once they completely re-wrote a set after releasing it because it was very unclear.<br>Lecturcises are a very large chunk of your grade which are due each Saturday night. Grading is very harsh in general but they also give thorough feedback. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>If you are deciding to choose between Ma6a and CS13 as a sophomore on grades, choose Ma6a if you want an A but I guarantee you will learn more in CS13. Being a sophomore with no experience in proof writing I can confidently say that my proofwriting abilities have improved exponentially from taking this class. However, I understand that the grading in this class is especially harsh to refine our proofwriting before taking CS21 but I feel like the penalties in each set were too harsh and almost demotivating, especially after spending 8-10 hours altogether on each set. I don't regret my choice because my main goal was to learn but I feel disappointed knowing that this was not reflected in my grade. If you are a freshman definitely take CS13 over Ma6a!!!!!!</td>

      <td>Highly recommend it over Math 6 if you're interested in CS applications! While the lectures can be very slow at times, it is worth it for the interesting sets and good proof-writing feedback.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>I went into this course after taking CS 21, and I chose it instead of Ma 6 because I wanted to learn more about the practical applications of discrete math to CS. I was pretty disappointed with this course. The material was overall very easy. The homework was divided into 4 "written" assignments and 3 "applications." The written assignments were all proofs. If you have experience with proof-based math, you'll probably find that none of the written assignments take much effort to figure out solutions to, and nearly all of the work is in writing up the solutions. The class has pretty high standards for the quality of the proofs, so if you're interested primarily in improving your proof-writing skill this class is a good option, but if you're comfortable with proofs you'll probably be disappointed by the lack of interesting problems. I also felt that the content of the applications assignments was a lot less interesting than it could have been. The applications assignments usually focused on a topic in CS (eg Huffman Codes, Naive Bayes classifiers) and involved a very small amount of coding followed by a series of proofs and/or written explanations. Most of the questions in the applications involved proving specific upper bounds, which got very tedious and didn't really do much to improve my understanding of the algorithms we were analyzing. Also, there was a lot less graph theory covered in the course than I expected.</td>

      <td>Take Ma 6 or whatever the alternative to this class is if you're taking this class to fulfill the CS requirement. This class is not worth it; they grade hard so don't expect an A+/A unless you scored pretty highly in CS 21/are just good at math proofs. The only thing is that if you haven't taken CS 21, and don't know much about proofs, then maybe this class is worth it; I, personally, feel much more prepared for CS 21 after this class, but I had to work incredibly hard just to get a good grade because of the structure of this class. Plus, its experimental still; if you wanna do urself a favor and take something easier and have already taken CS 21, just take Ma 6. </td>
