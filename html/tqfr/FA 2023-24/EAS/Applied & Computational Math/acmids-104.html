The only problems I had with the course is that I felt that a lot of the content felt repetitive of things from math 1b, but if the topics listed on the syllabus posted online are interesting to you, I recommend this class, even if it wasn't really for me. There wasn't too much workload, and feedback from TAs on sets were prompt and useful.</td>

      <td>This is a very useful class for really any engineering-related majors. You learn how to think in terms of matrices and vectors, and why these units matter so much in how we deal with data and real-world problems.<br><br>Homework: There are 6 sets, each of which are fairly reasonable. The first set is particularly cumbersome, but the rest of the sets are more relaxed. There is a subset of coding questions on each set, in which the general framework is outlined in a .mlx file. It is on the level (if not slightly above/below depending on the assignment) of ACM 11 if you have taken that class, ranging from simply filling in lines of code to implementing whole algorithms.<br><br>Exams: A bit tight on time if you are LaTeXing them (in my opinion), but otherwise very reasonable given the content presented in class.<br><br>I found lectures somewhat useful, it was fairly hit-or-miss depending on the content. But overall, I think Zuev's treatment of the large assortment of topics is very good, and I think anyone who seeks a more technical treatment of linear algebra and why it even matters.</td>

This class was basically just Ma1b juiced up.<br><br>The sets were easy and the exams were chill but I felt like I didn't really get much out of the class.</td>

      <td>This course definitely requires a significant amount of effort to understand the concepts and especially to solve the Homework assignments. The first few Homeworks were the hardest ones, probably because we were still not used to the way the course was organized. In the end, things were much smoother. Overall, I would say that this course is great for everybody interested in Linear Algebra and its applications, as well as to people who are interested in getting some hands-on experience with Matlab. </td>

      <td>It can be tricky for students like me who didn't take linear algebra in high school. I don't think Ma 1b Practical did a great job of preparing me for this course, especially for the more proof-based questions, but the assigned proofs are often very easy to get from the lecture notes if you study them closely enough. ACM 11 helped prepare me for the MatLab Questions, but there are usually enough hints to be able to get through those questions regardless. The MatLab questions were my favorite and probably the most interesting problems I've worked on in any math class at Caltech.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Definitely the best math course I've taken at Caltech. I had no experience with Matlab going into 104 and I didn't enjoy Math 1b, but this class did a really good job at explaining linear algebra and its applications. I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in linear algebra. There are six problem sets (lowest set grade is dropped) which include Matlab questions that focus on the applications of the topic for that week. The professor also posts his lecture notes on Piazza (although I'd definitely recommend attending lectures) and they're super useful. The TAs for the course were also great, so if you get stuck I'd highly recommend attending office hours or posting questions on Piazza.</td>

      <td>ACM104 is a great class. I stopped going to lectures after the second week, and the lecture notes provided were very in depth and more than enough for the problem sets. The problem sets are all very relevant to the material, and I found only the first set notably difficult compared to the rest (as this is the only "proof based" set and the rest are more so computation/coding). The topics in the class were also very relevant to my major (computer science), as we covered a lot of interesting topics (K-means clustering, SVD, etc.). The only downside is we use MATLAB, and MATLAB is .... not fun (wasn't even created by a cs major)</td>

      <td>Overall, a pretty good class. Personally, I didn't get as much out of it as I expected, as it turns out that most of the material in this class was already covered in Ma1b analytical. I would have definitely preferred learning more novel content, but the course was still fine regardless. The lecture notes and pretty good, and the textbook also covers most of the course content. If you did well in Ma1b, you'll should do fine in this class.</td>

      <td>So great! Definitely take all Zuev's courses (ACM104, 116, 157, 158). Be prepared that the later half materials are significantly harder / less familiar than those of first half. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>Make sure to go to office hours! They are generally very helpful. Prof. Zuev and the Head TA have also been lenient with extensions under reasonable circumstances which has been a relief (similar to ACM95 when Zuev teaches it). This class is particularly useful for MechEs and lines up with ME40 and Ph2a a bit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>This course it tough but fair as the material on sets covered course content clearly and material was covered in all aspects of the class, sets and exams. There were many coding aspects of the class with a focus on matlab. The matlab sections of the sets did not require an extensive background in CS to complete but familiarity with matlab is preferred. The midterm and final cover content in the first and second half of class respectively which doesn't necessitate content in the sets.</td>

      <td>Definitely a good course for cs majors who want to understand how linear algebra can contribute to some well known algorithms.

      <td>Excellent class, standard Zuev. Gave interesting perspective on some familiar classes covered in CS 144 (Networks), like PageRank and PCA. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lectures were explained very well. It was especially helpful how Professor Zuev would look around frequently to answer questions. Lecture notes are also thorough and easy enough to understand. The textbook can be helpful too. It was nice how sets were very closely related to what was taught in lecture. The sets were definitely at a fair level, not too easy or too tough with interesting content. I liked learning MATLAB through this class without having taken ACM 11 beforehand (I'm a CS major). Sets are about half written and half MATLAB code. The midterm exam was a little tough and the final exam was about the same. Overall, a great class for people who want to learn a little more about linear algebra after Ma 1b.</td>

      <td>ACM 104, at least for me, is another great ACM course that Caltech offers.  It is a great class to take.  I am a MechE and took it to satisfy my extra math requirement (and since it was a prereq for a class I wanted to take).  If you are on the fence and debating whether or not to take it, I would strongly recommend that you do.  I personally like linear algebra, so 104 was definitely enjoyable for me.  The first two weeks of the class basically start with a review of Ma1b stuff (like vector spaces, linear independence/dependence, etc.) and then builds off from there, though Ma1b content will reappear later in the course when you get to like eigenvectors and such.  <br><br>Professor Zuev is a great professor that really cares about your learning.  He posts his lecture notes after every lecture, and they are super comprehensive; they are honestly a substitute for going to lecture, and you can basically learn all of the material you need just from reading them. <br> That being said, I would still encourage you to go to lecture.  Professor Zuev does a great job at explaining things in class, and just showing up to lecture helps you stay on top of at least knowing what is going on in class and staying with the tempo of the rest of the class.  <br><br>As for homeworks, these are very reasonable.  They are not sets that take you super super long or try to get you stuck.  They are designed to actually help you learn by going through them.  You have a drop set, but honestly, just do them all.  Towards the end of the quarter, the assignments do get more MATLAB-heavy, though.  Also, the first set is known for being more theoretical than the latter ones.  Like I said, in the first two weeks you do a review of Ma1b stuff, so the first assignment will be much more theory- and proof-based than anything else, but later ones get more practical.  <br><br>TLDR: Great class, take it if you have space; Professor Zuev is great; homeworks not horrible.  </td>

      <td>A very well-constructed class. Outstanding professor who really cares about his students. Help is always given to those who need it.

      <td>This is an amazing course if you want to get a better understanding and foundation on linear algebra. I didn't really understand much from Ma1b, and although the beginning was a bit difficult for me as I didn't really understand matrices (really at all, if I'm being honest), but Prof. Zuev worked his magic and I ended up learning a lot and feeling much more confident about the course material in the end.<br>Highly highly recommend the course, and going to lectures if you can! Prof. Zuev's lectures are always amazing and the course is structured for the students to gain a lot out of it if you put in a bit of work and interest into it. Honestly, I'm just sad that I can't take more of Prof. Zuev's classes.<br>Grading is really similar to other Zuev classes, with 1 drop set, midterm and final. Office hours are really helpful and there are plenty of them each week to go to as needed. Midterm and final reviews are also super helpful.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>This was my first Zuev class and it did not disappoint! Lectures are worth attending, and even so, lecture notes are a gold mine for extracting key concepts. Pay heed to "remark" comments made in the notes as they can be quite helpful in understanding concepts. Additionally, I would just highly recommend taking 104, CS 156, and Ec 122 concurrently as they go very well together!</td>
