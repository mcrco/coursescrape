For Ma 1a and 1b prac, at the very least the textbooks were useful, but this course has one of the most unhelpful textbooks I've read in a long time. Trying to follow the methodology can sometimes be impossible due to lack of explanation and skipping over work and simply expecting the student to fill in the blanks. I've left this course feeling like I've learned almost nothing other than that differential equations can so easily be taught poorly.</td>

If you're disciplined enough, definitely try to go to lecture, but if you're like me and you just can't bring yourself to wake up and go there at 10am, that's okay too.</td>

This problem decreased somewhat as term progressed. Also, sometimes Professor Makarov would sometimes directly cover a question from the homework, but poorly enough that you would have to go to office hours anyways. At the very least, lectures were good for getting a first exposure to the material.<br><br>The sets were alright but picked up considerably in difficulty after midterms. At that point it became quite necessary to go to office hours/have a friend who went to office hours to ensure your approach and final answer were correct.<br><br>The midterm exam was a bit of a disaster — we were asked to apply concepts we hadn't learned yet, such as Clairaut equations. The professor apologized and the final exam did not suffer the same fate. Everything on the final exam was covered on the final review.<br><br>As for the material covered, we went quite deep in nonlinear systems. We also focused on extremely specific techniques/equation types, such as Clairaut equations, Bessel functions, Airy functions, etc. It felt rather repetitive at times, and more widely applicable techniques like series solutions and Laplace transforms were squeezed into the final week or two.<br><br>In the end, the class was curved with the following statistics:<br>Mean: 90, 1st quartile: 86, Median: 93, 3rd quartile: 97 (cut-off for A+), Standard deviation: 11<br><br>My time breakdown for each assignment: https://imgur.com/a/rb7U4EI</td>

The midterm review was not helpful and many of the exam questions were nothing like the types of questions from assignments, recitations or the textbook. After midterms, the course picked up significantly, and I found myself having to take extensions in order to complete the sets. Office hours became pretty full and I relied a lot on collaborating with others to do the sets. Thorgal's final review was very useful, so I'd highly recommend attending.<br><br>Some things I liked about the class were the extension policy (10 days, no questions asked) and that we were allowed to use Mathematica. <br><br>But yeah, if you're taking this class I recommend finding a group of people to work on sets with, attending recitations (because some of the recitation solutions are unclear), and attending office hours.

      <td>Ma2 is definitely a class that you might find yourself struggling through far more than you thought you would.  The class might start off easy with the first homework, but do not get stuck into thinking that it will just be easy.  It gets difficult very quickly, as long as you are like me and have not taken differential equations before coming to Caltech.  <br><br>As for getting homework done, like I already said, they increasingly more difficult as the term goes on, and often times you would need to go to office hours to find out what special substitution you would need to use in order to simplify/solve the equation.  The recitations that were posted were very helpful for the first part of the course in understanding the concepts and getting the homeworks done.  So either go to recitation or make sure you read the posted recitation notes.  <br><br>As for exams, I found these to be extremely difficult.  They are definitely meant to challenge you and unless you are keeping yourself up to date in the course, you might find it hard to even get started on some of the problems.  Definitely prepare as much as you can for them, get everything you can out of the review sessions that the TAs host, and make sure you have a clear understanding of what is going on in the class.  <br><br>As for lectures, you should really go to them.  I made the mistake of thinking that I could get away without showing up to lecture.  While for the first part of the class not skipping lectures was OK as I could still use the textbook to get through the homeworks, for the midterm, there was content on the test that was covered that week leading up to midterms.  So although these lectures are in the morning and you think you can get away with not going, unless you have already taken differential equations before, then I would strongly recommend going to lecture.  The main benefit is that then you at least have an idea of what content is being covered in the course and what you are expected to have learned, rather than just seeing what happens to be on each set and trying to learn just enough to answer the questions; this may not be so great when midterms roll around.  <br><br>All in all, be prepared to dedicate more time to this class than what you initially predict, do not brush it aside, make sure to prioritize it as much as your other major core classes, and make sure to stay as involved as possible (going to lectures/recitations) to have the best experience possible.  </td>

      <td>Lectures in this class are pretty bad. Although Prof Markov seems to have a solid understanding of the subject, he is not the best at explaining concepts and often brushes off questions. I would recommend reading recitation notes and going to recitation over going to lecture. Definitely go to the head TAs OH if stuck with Psets. The end of the class tends to be the most difficult in terms of conceps and problem sets. Also, do NOT trust the professor when he says the midterm and final are easy.</td>

      <td>It's probably required for your option, but I won't sweat it too much. If you take interest in the topics, it is actually a pretty fun class. I would strongly recommend going to lectures, as there are some treatments in the lectures that are not found in the textbook and are required for the midterm and final exams.</td>

      <td>This course if fine up until after the midterm. The sets after the midterm are so much harder and those sets took me at least 3 hours longer than the previous ones.</td>

      <td>Overall an ok class. The textbook hard carries, the TA's are good, and the recitation notes are useful. Most of the homework usually is fine but there's usually at least one really tough problem on it (same applies to midterm/final).</td>

    <tr>
      <td>You probably have to take this class for a core requirement, but honestly, its not that bad if you just put a lot of time toward it. Some of the sets later on do get kind of difficult, and the midterm and final are absolutely awful. However, they grade pretty lightly, so for the sets at least, just work with others and you'll do well in the class.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>If you try to go to two or three office hours a week it would be easier to get high scores on homework, which is 50% of the grade. Most parts of the homework is from the textbook. Also, try to look at the original problems on the textbook, they would often give you some hints on how to approach the problems. TAs were very helpful. The Midterm is definitely harder than the first 4 problem sets, and the final is a bit easier, the final review was crucial for doing the final. Several concepts that were not emphasized in lectures or problem sets were on the final, but was not too difficult. Problem sets 6 and 7 were especially hard, but the grading was lenient. </td>

    <tr>
      <td>This course started out as not too bad, but by the end of the course I was spending a decent bit of time on the sets. They were at times frustrating. Without having some previous knowledge of differential equations, the sets can be somewhat difficult and time-consuming. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>This class is unnecessarily difficult because the lectures and textbook are super uncoordinated. Go to recitation if you want to understand anything. If you miss recitation, make sure to go over the recitation notes and ask about it in office hours.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The class jumps around the textbook, making it a bit more difficult. The midterm will be very tough but the final will be much easier. Go to the midterm and final review. In our year the head TA's final review was very, very helpful. When completing homework, look at the recc notes, as they usually explain how to solve problems similar to the ones on the homework.</td>
